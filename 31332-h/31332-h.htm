<h2 class="spaced">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a "Journal of Impressions," and it is nothing
more. It will not satisfy people who want accurate
and substantial information about Belgium, or
about the War, or about Field Ambulances and Hospital
Work, and do not want to see any of these things
"across a temperament." For the Solid Facts and
the Great Events they must go to such books as Mr.
E. A. Powell's "Fighting in Flanders," or Mr. Frank
Fox's "The Agony of Belgium," or Dr. H. S. Souttar's
"A Surgeon in Belgium," or "A Woman's Experiences
in the Great War," by Louise Mack.</p>

<p>For many of these impressions I can claim only a
psychological accuracy; some were insubstantial to
the last degree, and very few were actually set down
there and then, on the spot, as I have set them down
here. This is only a Journal in so far as it is a record
of days, as faithful as I could make it in every detail,
and as direct as circumstances allowed. But circumstances
seldom <i>did</i> allow, and I was always behindhand
with my Journal&mdash;a week behind with the first
day of the seventeen, four months behind with the last.</p>

<p>This was inevitable. For in the last week of the
Siege of Antwerp, when the wounded were being
brought into Ghent by hundreds, and when the fighting
came closer and closer to the city, and at the end, when
the Germans were driving you from Ghent to Bruges,
and from Bruges to Ostend and from Ostend to Dunkirk,
you could not sit down to write your impressions,
even if you were cold-blooded enough to want to. It
was as much as you could do to scribble the merest
note of what happened in your Day-Book.</p>

<p>But when you had made fast each day with its note,
your impressions were safe, far safer than if you had
tried to record them in their flux as they came. However
far behind I might be with my Journal, it was
<i>kept</i>. It is not written "up," or round and about the
original notes in my Day-Book, it is simply written <i>out</i>.
Each day of the seventeen had its own quality and was
soaked in its own atmosphere; each had its own unique
and incorruptible memory, and the slight lapse of time,
so far from dulling or blurring that memory, crystallized
it and made it sharp and clean. And in writing
<i>out</i> I have been careful never to go behind or beyond
the day, never to add anything, but to leave each moment
as it was. I have set down the day's imperfect
or absurd impression, in all its imperfection or absurdity,
and the day's crude emotion in all its crudity,
rather than taint its reality with the discreet reflections
that came after.</p>

<p>I make no apology for my many errors&mdash;where
they were discoverable I have corrected them in a footnote;
to this day I do not know how wildly wrong I
may have been about kilometres and the points of the
compass, and the positions of batteries and the movements
of armies; but there were other things of which
I was dead sure; and this record has at least the value
of a "human document."</p>

<p class="tbspace">There is one question that I may be asked: "Why,
when you had the luck to go out with a Field Ambulance
Corps distinguished by its gallantry&mdash;why
in heaven's name have you not told the story of its
heroism?"</p>

<p>Well&mdash;I have not told it for several excellent reasons.
When I set out to keep a Journal I pledged
myself to set down only what I had seen or felt, and
to avoid as far as possible the second-hand; and it was
my misfortune that I saw very little of the field-work
of the Corps. Besides, the Corps itself was then in its
infancy, and it is its infancy&mdash;its irrepressible, half-irresponsible,
whole engaging infancy&mdash;that I have
touched here. After those seventeen days at Ghent
it grew up in all conscience. It was at Furnes and
Dixmude and La Panne, after I had left it, that its
most memorable deeds were done.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>And this story of the Corps is not mine to tell. Part
of it has been told already by Dr. Souttar, and part by
Mr. Philip Gibbs, and others. The rest is yet to come.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>September 25th, 1914.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the painful births and deaths of I don't
know how many committees, after six weeks'
struggling with something we imagined to be
Red Tape, which proved to be the combined egoism
of several persons all desperately anxious to "get
to the Front," and desperately afraid of somebody
else getting there too, and getting there first, we
are actually off. Impossible to describe the mysterious
processes by which we managed it. I think
the War Office kicked us out twice, and the Admiralty
once, though what we were doing with the
Admiralty I don't to this day understand. The
British Red Cross kicked us steadily all the time,
on general principles; the American snubbed us
rather badly; what the French said to us I don't remember,
and I can't think that we carried persistency
so far as to apply to the Russian and the Japanese.
Many of our scheme perished in their own
vagueness. Others, vivid and adventurous, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
checked by the first encounter with the crass reality.
At one time, I remember, we were to have sent out
a detachment of stalwart Amazons in khaki breeches
who were to dash out on to the battle-field, reconnoitre,
and pick up the wounded and carry them
away slung over their saddles. The only difficulty
was to get the horses. But the author of the
scheme&mdash;who had bought her breeches&mdash;had allowed
for that. The horses were to be caught on
the battle-field; as the wounded and dead dropped
from their saddles the Amazons were to leap into
them and ride off. On this system "remounts"
were also to be supplied. Whenever a horse was
shot dead under its rider, an Amazon was to dash
up with another whose rider had been shot dead.
It was all perfectly simple and only needed a little
"organization." For four weeks the lure of the
battle-field kept our volunteers dancing round the
War Office and the Red Cross Societies, and for
four weeks their progress to the Front was frustrated
by Lord Kitchener. Some dropped off disheartened,
but others came on, and a regenerated
committee dealt with them. Finally the thing crystallized
into a Motor Ambulance Corps. An awful
sanity came over the committee, chastened by its
sufferings, and the volunteers, under pressure, definitely
renounced the battle-field.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Then somebody said, "Let's help the Belgian
refugees." From that moment our course was
clear. Everybody was perfectly willing that we
should help the refugees, provided we relinquished
all claim on the wounded. The Belgian Legation
was enchanted. It gave passports to a small private
commission of inquiry under our Commandant
to go out to Belgium and send in a report. At Ostend
the commission of inquiry whittled itself down
to the one energetic person who had taken it out.
And before we knew where we were our Ambulance
Corps was accepted by the Belgian Red Cross.</p>

<p>Only we had not got the ambulances.</p>

<p>And though we had got some money, we had not
got enough. This was really our good luck, for it
saved us from buying the wrong kind of motor ambulance
car. But at first the blow staggered us.
Then, by some abrupt, incalculable turn of destiny,
the British Red Cross, which had kicked us so persistently,
came to our help and gave us all the ambulances
we wanted.</p>

<p>And we are off.</p>

<p>There are thirteen of us: The Commandant,
and Dr. Haynes and Dr. Bird under him; and Mrs.
Torrence, a trained nurse and midwife, who can
drive a motor car through anything, and take it to
bits and put it together again; Janet McNeil, also an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
expert motorist, and Ursula Dearmer and Mrs.
Lambert, Red Cross emergency nurses; Mr. Grierson,
Mr. Foster and Mr. Riley, stretcher-bearers,
and two chauffeurs and me. I don't know where I
come in. But they've called me the Secretary and
Reporter, which sounds very fine, and I am to keep
the accounts (Heaven help them!) and write the
Commandant's reports, and toss off articles for the
daily papers, to make a little money for the Corps.
We've got some already, raised by the Commandant's
Report and Appeal that we published in the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> and <i>Daily Chronicle</i>. I shall never
forget how I sprinted down Fleet Street to get it
in in time, four days before we started.</p>

<p>And we have landed at Ostend.</p>

<p>I'll confess now that I dreaded Ostend more than
anything. We had been told that there were horrors
upon horrors in Ostend. Children were being
born in the streets, and the state of the bathing-machines
where the refugees lived was unspeakable.
I imagined the streets of Ostend crowded with
refugee women bearing children, and the Digue
covered with the horrific bathing-machines. On
the other hand, Ostend was said to be the safest
spot in Europe. No Germans there. No Zeppelins.
No bombs.</p>

<p>And we found the bathing-machines planted out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
several miles from the town, almost invisible specks
on a vanishing shore-line. The refugees we met
walking about the streets of Ostend were in fairly
good case and bore themselves bravely. But the
town had been bombarded the night before and our
hotel had been the object of very special attentions.
We chose it (the "Terminus") because it lay close
to the landing-stage and saved us the trouble of
going into the town to look for quarters. It was
under the same roof as the railway station, where
we proposed to leave our ambulance cars and heavy
luggage. And we had no difficulty whatever in getting
rooms for the whole thirteen of us. There was
no sort of competition for rooms in that hotel.
I said to myself, "If Ostend ever is bombarded,
this railway station will be the first to suffer. And
the hotel and the railway station are one." And
when I was shown into a bedroom with glass windows
all along its inner wall and a fine glass front
looking out on to the platforms under the immense
glass roof of the station, I said, "If this hotel
is ever bombarded, what fun it will be for the person
who sleeps in this bed between these glass windows."</p>

<p>We were all rather tired and hungry as we met
for dinner at seven o'clock. And when we were
told that all lights would be put out in the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
at eight-thirty we only thought that a municipality
which was receiving all the refugees in Belgium
must practise <i>some</i> economy, and that, anyway, an
hour and a half was enough for anybody to dine
in; and we hoped that the Commandant, who had
gone to call on the English chaplain at the Grand
Hôtel Littoral, would find his way back again to
the peaceful and commodious shelter of the "Terminus."</p>

<p>He did find his way back, at seven-thirty, just
in time to give us a chance of clearing out, if we
chose to take it. The English chaplain, it seemed,
was surprised and dismayed at our idea of a suitable
hotel, and he implored us to fly, instantly, before
a bomb burst in among us (this was the first
we had heard of the bombardment of the night before).
The Commandant put it to us as we sat
there: Whether would we leave that dining-room
at once and pack our baggage all over again, and
bundle out, and go hunting for rooms all through
Ostend with the lights out, and perhaps fall into the
harbour; or stay where we were and risk the off-chance
of a bomb? And we were all very tired and
hungry, and we had only got to the soup, and we
had seen (and smelt) the harbour, so we said we'd
stay where we were and risk it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>And we stayed. A Taube hovered over us and
never dropped its bomb.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Saturday, 26th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we compared notes the next morning we
found that we had all gone soundly to sleep, too
tired to take the Taube seriously, all except our two
chauffeurs, who were downright annoyed because no
bomb had entered their bedroom. Then we all went
out and looked at the little hole in the roof of the
fish market, and the big hole in the hotel garden,
and thought of bombs as curious natural phenomena
that never had and never would have any intimate
connection with <i>us</i>.</p>

<p>And for five weeks, ever since I knew that I must
certainly go out with this expedition, I had been
living in black funk; in shameful and appalling
terror. Every night before I went to sleep I saw
an interminable spectacle of horrors: trunks without
heads, heads without trunks, limbs tangled in
intestines, corpses by every roadside, murders, mutilations,
my friends shot dead before my eyes.
Nothing I shall ever see will be more ghastly than
the things I have seen. And yet, before a possibly-to-be-bombarded
Ostend this strange visualizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
process ceases, and I see nothing and feel nothing.
Absolutely nothing; until suddenly the Commandant
announces that he is going into the town, by himself,
to <i>buy a hat</i>, and I get my first experience of
real terror.</p>

<p>For the hats that the Commandant buys when he
is by himself&mdash;there are no words for them.</p>

<p>This morning the Corps begins to realize its need
of discipline. First of all, our chauffeurs have disappeared
and can nowhere be found. The motor
ambulances languish in inactivity on Cockerill's
Wharf. We find one chauffeur and set him to keep
guard over a tin of petrol. We <i>know</i> the ambulances
can't start till heaven knows when, and
so, first Mrs. Lambert, our emergency nurse, then,
I regret to say, our Secretary and Reporter make
off and sneak into the Cathedral. We are only ten
minutes, but still we are away, and Mrs. Torrence,
our trained nurse, is ready for us when we come
back. We are accused bitterly of sight-seeing.
(We had betrayed the inherent levity of our nature
the day before, on the boat, when we looked at the
sunset.) Then the Secretary and Reporter, utterly
intractable, wanders forth ostensibly to look for the
Commandant, who has disappeared, but really to
get a sight of the motor ambulances on Cockerill's
Wharf. And Mrs. Torrence is ready again for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Secretary, convicted now of sight-seeing. And I
have seen no Commandant, and no motor ambulances
and no wharf. (Unbearable thought, that I
may never, absolutely never, see Cockerill's Wharf!)
It is really awful this time, because the President of
the Belgian Red Cross is waiting to get the thirteen
of us to the Town Hall to have our passports <i>visés</i>.
And the Commandant is rounding up his Corps, and
Ursula Dearmer is heaven knows where, and Mrs.
Lambert only somewhere in the middle distance,
and Mrs. Torrence's beautiful eyes are blazing at
the slip-sloppiness of it all. Things were very
different at the &mdash;&mdash; Hospital, where she was
trained.</p>

<p>Only the President remains imperturbable.</p>

<p>For, after all this fuming and fretting, the President
isn't quite ready himself, or perhaps the Town
Hall isn't ready, and we all stroll about the streets
of Ostend for half an hour. And the Commandant
goes off by himself, to buy that hat.</p>

<p>It is a terrible half-hour. But after all, he comes
back without it, judging it better to bear the ills he
has.</p>

<p>Very leisurely, and with an immense consumption
of time, we stroll and get photographed for our passports.
Then on to the Town Hall, and then to the
Military Depôt for our <i>Laissez-passer</i>, and then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the Hôtel Terminus for lunch. And at one-thirty
we are off.</p>

<p>Whatever happens, whatever we see and suffer,
nothing can take from us that run from Ostend to
Ghent.</p>

<p>We go along a straight, flat highway of grey
stones, through flat, green fields and between thin
lines of trees&mdash;tall and slender and delicate trees.
There are no hedges. Only here and there a row
of poplars or pollard willows is flung out as a screen
against the open sky. This country is formed for
the very expression of peace. The straight flat
roads, the straight flat fields and straight tall trees
stand still in an immense quiet and serenity. We
pass low Flemish houses with white walls and red
roofs. Their green doors and shutters are tall and
slender like the trees, the colours vivid as if the
paint had been laid on yesterday. It is all unspeakably
beautiful and it comes to me with the natural,
inevitable shock and ecstasy of beauty. I am going
straight into the horror of war. For all I know
it may be anywhere, here, behind this sentry; or
there, beyond that line of willows. I don't know.
I don't care. I cannot realize it. All that I can
see or feel at the moment is this beauty. I look
and look, so that I may remember it.</p>

<p>Is it possible that I am enjoying myself?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>I dare not tell Mrs. Torrence. I dare not tell
any of the others. They seem to me inspired with
an austere sense of duty, a terrible integrity. They
know what they are here for. To me it is incredible
that I should be here.</p>

<p>I am in Car 1., sitting beside Tom, the chauffeur;
Mrs. Torrence is on the other side of me. Tom
disapproves of these Flemish roads. He cannot see
that they are beautiful. They will play the devil
with his tyres.</p>

<p>I am reminded unpleasantly that our Daimler is
not a touring car but a motor ambulance and that
these roads will jolt the wounded most abominably.</p>

<p>There are straggling troops on the road now.
At the nearest village all the inhabitants turn out
to cheer us. They cry out "<i>Les Anglais!</i>" and
laugh for joy. Perhaps they think that if the British
Red Cross has come the British Army can't
be far behind. But when they hear that we are
Belgian Red Cross they are gladder than ever.
They press round us. It is wonderful to them that
we should have come all the way from England
"<i>pour les Belges!</i>" Somehow the beauty of the
landscape dies before these crowding, pressing faces.</p>

<p>We pass through Bruges without seeing it. I
have no recollection whatever of having seen the
Belfry. We see nothing but the Canal (where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
halt to take in petrol) and more villages, more faces.
And more troops.</p>

<p>Half-way between Bruges and Ghent an embankment
thrown up on each side of the road tells of
possible patrols and casual shooting. It is the first
visible intimation that the enemy may be anywhere.</p>

<p>A curious excitement comes to you. I suppose
it is excitement, though it doesn't feel like it. You
have been drunk, very slightly drunk with the speed
of the car. But now you are sober. Your heart
beats quietly, steadily, but with a little creeping,
mounting thrill in the beat. The sensation is distinctly
pleasurable. You say to yourself, "It is
coming. Now&mdash;or the next minute&mdash;perhaps at
the end of the road." You have one moment of
regret. "After all, it would be a pity if it came too
soon, before we'd even begun our job." But the
thrill, mounting steadily, overtakes the regret. It
is only a little thrill, so far (for you don't really
believe that there is any danger), but you can imagine
the thing growing, growing steadily, till it becomes
ecstasy. Not that you imagine anything at
the moment. At the moment you are no longer an
observing, reflecting being; you have ceased to be
aware of yourself; you exist only in that quiet,
steady thrill that is so unlike any excitement that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
you have ever known. Presently you get used to
it. "What a fool I should have been if I hadn't
come. I wouldn't have missed this run for the
world."</p>

<p>I forget myself so far as to say this to Mrs. Torrence.
My voice doesn't sound at all like the stern
voice of duty. It is the voice of somebody enjoying
herself. I am behaving exactly as I behaved
this morning at Ostend; and cannot possibly hope
for any sympathy from Mrs. Torrence.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Torrence has unbent a little. She has
in fact been unbending gradually ever since we left
Ostend. There is a softer light in her beautiful
eyes. For she is not only a trained nurse but an
expert motorist; and a Daimler is a Daimler even
when it's an ambulance car. From time to time
remarks of a severely technical nature are exchanged
between her and Tom. Still, up till now, nothing
has passed to indicate any flagging in the relentless
spirit of the &mdash;&mdash; Hospital.</p>

<p>The next minute I hear that the desire of Mrs.
Torrence's heart is to get into the greatest possible
danger&mdash;and to get out of it.</p>

<p>The greatest possible danger is to fall into the
hands of the Uhlans. I feel that I should be very
glad indeed to get out of it, but that I'm not by
any means so keen on getting in. I say so. I con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>fess
frankly that I'm afraid of Uhlans, particularly
when they're drunk.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Torrence is not afraid of anything.
There is no German living, drunk or sober, who
could break her spirit. Nothing dims for her that
shining vision of the greatest possible danger. She
does not know what fear is.</p>

<p>I conceive an adoration for Mrs. Torrence, and
a corresponding distaste for myself. For I do
know what fear is. And in spite of the little
steadily-mounting thrill, I remember distinctly those
five weeks of frightful anticipation when I knew
that I must go out to the War; the going to bed,
night after night, drugged with horror, black horror
that creeps like poison through your nerves; the
falling asleep and forgetting it; the waking, morning
after morning, with an energetic and lucid brain
that throws out a dozen war pictures to the minute
like a ghastly cinema show, till horror becomes terror;
the hunger for breakfast; the queer, almost
uncanny revival of courage that follows its satisfaction;
the driving will that strengthens as the day
goes on and slackens its hold at evening. I remember
one evening very near the end; the Sunday
evening when the Commandant dropped in, after he
had come back from Belgium. We were stirring
soup over the gas stove in the scullery&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
couldn't imagine a more peaceful scene&mdash;when he
said, "They are bringing up the heavy siege guns
from Namur, and there is going to be a terrific
bombardment of Antwerp, and I think it will be
very interesting for you to see it." I remember
replying with passionate sincerity that I would
rather die than see it; that if I could nurse the
wounded I would face any bombardment you please
to name; but to go and look on and make copy out
of the sufferings I cannot help&mdash;I couldn't and
I wouldn't, and that was flat. And I wasn't a journalist
any more than I was a trained nurse.</p>

<p>I can still see the form of the Commandant rising
up on the other side of the scullery stove, and in his
pained, uncomprehending gaze and in the words
he utters I imagine a challenge. It is as if he said,
"Of course, if you're <i>afraid</i>"&mdash;(haven't I told him
that I <i>am</i> afraid?).</p>

<p>The gage is thrown down on the scullery floor.
I pick it up. And that is why I am here on this
singular adventure.</p>

<p>Thus, for the next three kilometres, I meditate on
my cowardice. It is all over as if it had never been,
but how can I tell that it won't come back again?
I can only hope that when the Uhlans appear I
shall behave decently. And this place that we have
come to is Ecloo. We are not very far from Ghent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>A church spire, a few roofs rising above trees.
Then many roofs all together. Then the beautiful
grey-white foreign city.</p>

<p>As we run through the streets we are followed
by cyclists; cyclists issue from every side-street and
pour into our road; cyclists rise up out of the ground
to follow us. We don't realize all at once that
it is the ambulance they are following. Bowing
low like racers over their handle-bars, they shoot
past us; they slacken pace and keep alongside, they
shoot ahead; the cyclists are most fearfully excited.
It dawns on us that they are escorting us; that they
are racing each other; that they are bringing the
news of our arrival to the town. They behave as
if we were the vanguard of the British Army.</p>

<p>We pass the old Military Hospital&mdash;<i>Hôpital
Militaire</i> No. I.&mdash;and presently arrive at the Flandria
Palace Hotel, which is <i>Hôpital Militaire</i> No.
II. The cyclists wheel off, scatter and disappear.
The crowd in the Place gathers round the porch of
the hotel to look at the English Ambulance.</p>

<p>We enter. We are received by various officials
and presented to Madame F., the head of the Red
Cross nursing staff. There is some confusion, and
Mrs. Torrence finds herself introduced as the Secretary
of the English Committee. Successfully concealed
behind the broadest back in the Corps, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
belongs to Mr. Grierson, I have time to realize how
funny we all are. Everybody in the hospital is in
uniform, of course. The nurses of the Belgian Red
Cross wear white linen overalls with the brassard
on one sleeve, and the Red Cross on the breasts of
their overalls, and over their foreheads on the front
of their white linen veils. The men wear military
or semi-military uniforms. We had never agreed
as to our uniform, and some of us had had no time
to get it, if we had agreed. Assembled in the vestibule,
we look more like a party of refugees, or the
cast of a Barrie play, than a field ambulance corps.
Mr. Grierson, the Chaplain, alone wears complete
khaki, in which he is indistinguishable from any
Tommy. The Commandant, obeying some mysterious
inspiration, has left his khaki suit behind. He
wears a Norfolk jacket and one of his hats. Mr.
Foster in plain clothes, with a satchel slung over his
shoulders, has the air of an inquiring tourist. Mrs.
Torrence and Janet McNeil in short khaki tunics,
khaki putties, and round Jaeger caps, and very thick
coats over all, strapped in with leather belts, look
as if they were about to sail on an Arctic expedition;
I was told to wear dark blue serge, and I
wear it accordingly; Ursula Dearmer and Mrs.
Lambert are in normal clothes. But the amiable
officials and the angelic Belgian ladies behave as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
if there was nothing in the least odd about our appearance.
They remember only that we are English
and that it is now six o'clock and that we have
had no tea. They conceive this to be the most deplorable
fate that can overtake the English, and
they hurry us into the great kitchen to a round table,
loaded with cake and bread-and-butter and enormous
bowls of tea. The angelic beings in white
veils wait on us. We are hungry and we think (a
pardonable error) that this meal is hospital supper;
after which some work will surely be found for us
to do.</p>

<p>We are shown to our quarters on the third floor.
We expect two bare dormitories with rows of hard
beds, which we are prepared to make ourselves, besides
sweeping the dormitories, and we find a fine
suite of rooms&mdash;a mess-room, bedrooms, dressing-rooms,
bathrooms&mdash;and hospital orderlies for our
<i>valets de chambre</i>.</p>

<p>We unpack, sit round the mess-room and wait
for orders. Perhaps we may all be sent down into
the kitchen to wash up. Personally, I hope we shall
be, for washing up is a thing I can do both quickly
and well. It is now seven o'clock.</p>

<p>At half-past we are sent down into the kitchen,
not to wash up, but, if you will believe it, to dine.
And more hospital orderlies wait on us at dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The desire of our hearts is to do <i>something</i>, if
it is only to black the boots of the angelic beings.
But no, there is nothing for us to do. To-morrow,
perhaps, the doctors and stretcher-bearers will be
busy. We hear that only five wounded have been
brought into the hospital to-day. They have no
ambulance cars, and ours will be badly needed&mdash;to-morrow.
But to-night, no.</p>

<p>We go out into the town, to the Hôtel de la Poste,
and sit outside the café and drink black coffee in
despair. We find our chauffeurs doing the same
thing. Then we go back to our sumptuous hotel
and so, dejectedly, to bed. Aeroplanes hover above
us all night.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Sunday, 27th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> hang about waiting for orders. They may
come at any moment. Meanwhile this place grows
incredible and fantastic. Now it is an hotel and
now it is a military hospital; its two aspects shift
and merge into each other with a dream-like effect.
It is a huge building of extravagant design, wearing
its turrets, its balconies, its very roofs, like so much
decoration. The gilded legend, "Flandria Palace
Hotel," glitters across the immense white façade.
But the Red Cross flag flies from the front and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the corners of the turrets and from the balconies of
the long flank facing south. You arrive under a
fan-like porch that covers the smooth slope of the
approach. You enter your hotel through mahogany
revolving doors. A colossal Flora stands by the
lift at the foot of the big staircase. Unaware that
this is no festival of flowers, the poor stupid thing
leans forward, smiling, and holds out her garland
to the wounded as they are carried past. Nobody
takes any notice of her. The great hall of the hotel
has been stripped bare. All draperies and ornaments
have disappeared. The proprietor has disappeared,
or goes about disguised as a Red Cross
officer. The grey mosaic of floors and stairs is
cleared of rugs and carpeting; the reading-room is
now a secretarial bureau; the billiard-room is an
operating theatre; the great dining-hall and the reception-rooms
and the bedrooms are wards. The
army of waiters and valets and chambermaids has
gone, and everywhere there are surgeons, ambulance
men, hospital orderlies and the Belgian nurses with
their white overalls and red crosses. And in every
corridor and on every staircase and in every room
there is a mixed odour, bitter and sweet and penetrating,
of antiseptics and of ether. When the ambulance
cars come up from the railway stations and
the battle-fields, the last inappropriate detail, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
mahogany revolving doors, will disappear, so that
the wounded may be carried through on their
stretchers.</p>

<p>I confess to a slight, persistent fear of <i>seeing</i>
these wounded whom I cannot help. It is not very
active, it has left off visualizing the horror of
bloody bandages and mangled bodies. But it's
there; it waits for me in every corridor and at the
turn of every stair, and it makes me loathe myself.</p>

<p>We have news this morning of a battle at Alost,
a town about fifteen kilometres south-east of Ghent.
The Belgians are moving forty thousand men from
Antwerp towards Ghent, and heavy fighting is expected
near the town. If we are not in the thick
of it, we are on the edge of the thick.</p>

<p>They have just told us an awful thing. Two
wounded men were left lying out on the battle-field
all night after yesterday's fighting. The military
ambulances did not fetch them. Our ambulance
was not sent out. There are all sorts of formalities
to be observed before it can go. We haven't got
our military passes yet. And our English Red
Cross brassards are no use. We must have Belgian
ones stamped with the Government stamp. And
these things take time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we, who have still the appearance of
a disorganized Cook's tourist party, are beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to realize each other, the first step to realizing ourselves.
We have come from heaven knows where
to live together here heaven knows for how long.
The Commandant and I are friends; Mrs. Torrence
and Janet McNeil are friends; Dr. Haynes and Dr.
Bird are evidently friends; our chauffeurs, Bert and
Tom, are bound to fraternize professionally; we and
they are all right; but these pairs were only known
to each other a week or two ago, and some of the
thirteen never met at all till yesterday. An unknown
fourteenth is coming to-day. We are five
women and nine men. You might wonder how, for
all social purposes, we are to sort ourselves? But
the idea, sternly emphasized by Mrs. Torrence, is
that we have no social purposes. We are neither
more nor less than a strictly official and absolutely
impersonal body, held together, not by the ordinary
affinities of men and women, but by a common devotion
and a common aim. Differences, if any
should exist, will be sunk in the interest of the community.
Probabilities that rule all human intercourse,
as we have hitherto known it, will be temporarily
suspended in our case. But we shall gain
more than we lose. Insignificant as individuals, as
a corps we share the honour and prestige of the
Military Authority under which we work. We
have visions of a relentless discipline commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and controlling us. A cold glory hovers over the
Commandant as the vehicle of this transcendent
power.</p>

<p>When the Power has its way with us it will take
no count of friendships or affinities. It will set precedence
at naught. It will say to itself, "Here are
two field ambulance cars and fourteen people. Five
out of these fourteen are women, and what the devil
are they doing in a field ambulance?" And it will
appoint two surgeons, who will also serve as
stretcher-bearers, to each car; it will set our trained
nurse, Mrs. Torrence, in command of the untrained
nurses in one of the wards of the Military Hospital
No. II.; the Hospital itself will find suitable feminine
tasks for Ursula Dearmer and Mrs. Lambert;
while Janet McNeil and the Secretary will be told
off to work among the refugees. And until more
stretcher-bearers are wanted the rest of us will be
nowhere. If nothing can be found for our women
in the Hospital they will be sent home.</p>

<p>It seems inconceivable that the Power, if it is
anything like Lord Kitchener, can decide otherwise.</p>

<p>Odd how the War changes us. I, who abhor and
resist authority, who hardly know how I am to bring
myself to obey my friend the Commandant, am enamoured
of this Power and utterly submissive. I
realize with something like a thrill that we are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
a military hospital under military orders; and that
my irrelevant former self, with all that it has desired
or done, must henceforth cease (perhaps irrevocably)
to exist. I contemplate its extinction
with equanimity. I remember that one of my
brothers was a Captain in the Gunners, that another
of them fought as a volunteer in the first Boer War;
that my uncle, Captain Hind, of the Bengal Fusiliers,
fought in the Mutiny and in the Crimean War, and
his son at Chitral, and that I have one nephew in
Kitchener's Army and one in the West Lancashire
Hussars; and that three generations of solid sugar-planters
and ship-owners cannot separate me from
my forefathers, who seem to have been fighting all
the time. (At the moment I have forgotten my
five weeks' blue funk.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence's desire for discipline is not more
sincere than mine. Meanwhile the hand that is to
lick us into shape hovers over us and does not fall.
We wait expectantly in the mess-room which is to
contain us.</p>

<p>It was once the sitting-room of a fine suite. A
diminutive vestibule divides it from the corridor.
You enter through double doors with muffed glass
panes in a wooden partition opposite the wide
French windows opening on the balcony. A pale
blond light from the south fills the room. Its walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
are bare except for a map of Belgium, faced by a
print from one of the illustrated papers representing
the King and Queen of the Belgians. Of its
original furnishings only a few cane chairs and a
settee remain. These are set back round the walls
and in the window. Long tables with marble tops,
brought up from what was once the hotel restaurant,
enclose three sides of a hollow square, like this:</p>

<p class="figcenterns">
<img src="images/table.png" width="300" height="151" alt="Table Diagram" /></p>

<p>Round these we group ourselves thus: the Commandant
in the middle of the top table in the window,
between Mrs. Torrence and Ursula Dearmer;
Dr. Haynes and Dr. Bird, on the other side of Ursula
Dearmer; the chauffeurs, Tom and Bert, round the
corner at the right-hand side table; I am round the
other corner at the left-hand side table, by Mrs.
Torrence, and Janet McNeil is on my right, and on
hers are Mrs. Lambert and Mr. Foster and the
Chaplain. Mr. Riley sits alone on the inside opposite
Mrs. Torrence.</p>

<p>This rather quiet and very serious person interests
me. He doesn't say anything, and you wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
what sort of consciousness goes on under the close-cropped,
boyish, black velvet hair. Nature has left
his features a bit unfinished, the further to baffle
you.</p>

<p>All these people are interesting, intensely interesting
and baffling, as men and women are bound to
be who have come from heaven knows where to
face heaven knows what. Most of them are quite
innocently unaware. They do not know that they
are interesting, or baffling either. They do not
know, and it has not occurred to them to wonder,
how they are going to affect each other or how they
are going to behave. Nobody, you would say, is
going to affect the Commandant. When he is not
dashing up and down, driven by his mysterious
energy, he stands apart in remote and dreamy isolation.
His eyes, when they are not darting brilliantly
in pursuit of the person or the thing he needs,
stand apart too in a blank, blue purity, undarkened
by any perception of the details that may accumulate
under his innocent nose. He has called this corps
into being, gathered these strange men and women
up with a sweep of his wing and swept them almost
violently together. He doesn't know how any of
us are going to behave. He has taken for granted,
with his naïve and heart-rending trust in the beauty
of human nature, that we are all going to behave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
beautifully. He is absorbed in his scheme. Each
one of us fits into it at some point, and if there is
anything in us left over it is not, at the moment,
his concern.</p>

<p>Yet he himself has margins about him and a
mysterious hinterland not to be confined or accounted
for by any scheme. He alone of us has the
air, buoyant, restless, and a little vague, of being in
for some tremendous but wholly visionary adventure.</p>

<p>When I look at him I wonder again what this
particular adventure is going to do to him, and
whether he has, even now, any vivid sense of the
things that are about to happen. I remember that
evening in my scullery, and how he talked about the
German siege-guns as if they were details in some
unreal scene, the most interesting part, say, of a
successful cinematograph show.</p>

<p>But they are really bringing up those siege-guns
from Namur.</p>

<p>And the Commandant has brought four women
with him besides me. I confess I was appalled
when I first knew that they would be brought.</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence, perhaps&mdash;for she is in love with
danger,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and she is of the kind whom no power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
military or otherwise, can keep back from their desired
destiny.</p>

<p>But why little Janet McNeil?<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> She is the youngest
of us, an eighteen-year-old child who has followed
Mrs. Torrence, and will follow her if she
walks straight into the German trenches. She sits
beside me on my right, ready for anything, all her
delicate Highland beauty bundled up in the kit of
a little Arctic explorer, utterly determined, utterly
impassive. Her small face, under the woolly cap
that defies the North Pole, is nearly always grave;
but it has a sudden smile that is adorable.</p>

<p>And the youngest but one, Ursula Dearmer, who
can't be so much older&mdash;Mr. Riley's gloom and
the Commandant's hinterland are nothing to the
mystery of this young girl. She looks as if she
were not yet perfectly awake, as if it would take
considerably more than the siege-guns of Namur
to rouse her. She moves about slowly, as if she
were in no sort of hurry for the adventure. She
has slow-moving eyes, with sleepy, drooping eyelids
that blink at you. She has a rather sleepy, rather
drooping nose. Her shoulders droop; her small
head droops, slightly, half the time. If she were
not so slender she would be rather like a pretty dor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>mouse
half-recovering from its torpor. You insist
on the determination of her little thrust-out underlip,
only to be contradicted by her gentle and
delicately-retreating chin.</p>

<p>In our committee-room, among a band of turbulent
female volunteers, all clamouring for the firing-line,
Ursula Dearmer, dressed very simply, rather
like a senior school-girl, and accompanied by her
mother, had a most engaging air of submission and
docility. If anybody breaks out into bravura it
will not be Ursula Dearmer.</p>

<p>This thought consoles me when I think of the
last solemn scenes in that committee-room and of
the pledges, the frightfully sacred pledges, I gave
to Ursula Dearmer's mother. As a result of this
responsibility I see myself told off to the dreary
duty of conducting Ursula Dearmer back to Dover
at the moment when things begin to be really thick
and thrilling. And I deplore the Commandant's
indiscriminate hospitality to volunteers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambert (she must surely be the next youngest)
you can think of with less agitation, in spite
of her youth, her charming eyes and the recklessly
extravagant quantity of her golden hair. For she
is an American citizen, and she has a husband (also
an American citizen) in Ghent, and her husband has
a high-speed motor-car, and if the Germans should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
ever advance upon this city he can be relied upon to
take her out of it before they can possibly get in.
Besides, even in the German lines American citizens
are safe.</p>

<p>We are all suffering a slight tension. The men,
who can see no reason why the ambulance should
not have been sent out last night, are restless and
abstracted and impatient for the order to get up and
go. No wonder. They have been waiting five
weeks for their chance.</p>

<p>There is Dr. Haynes, whose large dark head and
heavy shoulders look as if they sustained the whole
weight of an intolerable world. His features, designed
for sensuous composure, brood in a sad and
sulky resignation to the boredom of delay.</p>

<p>His friend, Dr. Bird, the young man with the
head of an enormous cherub and the hair of a blond
baby, hair that <i>will</i> fall in a shining lock on his
pink forehead, Dr. Bird has an air of boisterous
preparation, as if the ambulance were a picnic party
and he was responsible for the champagne.</p>

<p>Mr. Foster, the inquiring tourist, looks a little
anxious, as if he were preoccupied with the train
he's got to catch.</p>

<p>Bert, the chauffeur, sits tight with the grim assurance
of a man who knows that the expedition
cannot start without him. The chauffeur Tom has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
an expressive face. Every minute it becomes more
vivid with humorous, contemptuous, indignant protest.
It says plainly: "Well, this is about the rottenest
show I ever was let in for. Bar none. Call
yourself a field ambulance? Garn! And if you
<i>are</i> a field ambulance, who but a blanky fool would
have hit upon this old blankety haunt of peace. It'll
be the 'Ague Conference next!"</p>

<p>But it is on the Chaplain, Mr. Grierson, that the
strain is telling most. It shows in his pale and
prominent blue eyes, and in a slight whiteness about
his high cheek-bones. In his valiant khaki he has
more than any of us the air of being on the eve.
He is visibly bracing himself to a stupendous effort.
He smokes a cigarette with ostentatious nonchalance.
We all think we know these symptoms.
We turn our eyes away, considerately, from Mr.
Grierson. Which of us can say that when our turn
comes the thought of danger will not spoil our
breakfast?</p>

<p>The poor boy squares his shoulders. He is white
now round the edges of his lips. But he is going
through with it.</p>

<p>Suddenly he speaks.</p>

<p>"I shall hold Matins in this room at ten o'clock
every Sunday morning. If any of you like to attend
you may."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a terrible silence. None of us look at
each other. None of us look at Mr. Grierson.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Torrence is heard protesting that
we haven't come here for Matins; that this is a
mess-room and not a private chapel; and that Matins
are against all military discipline.</p>

<p>"I shall hold Matins all the same," says Mr.
Grierson. His voice is thick and jerky. "And if
anybody likes to attend, they can. That's all I've
got to say."</p>

<p>He gets up. He faces the batteries of unholy
and unsympathetic eyes. He throws away the end
of his cigarette with a gesture of superb defiance.</p>

<p>He has gone through with it. He has faced the
fire. He has come out, not quite victorious, but
with his hero's honour unstained.</p>

<p>It seemed to me awful that none of us should
want his Matins. I should like, personally, to see
him through with them. I could face the hostile
eyes. But what I cannot face is the ceremony itself.
My <i>moral</i> was spoiled with too many ceremonies
in my youth; ceremonies that lacked all
beauty and sincerity and dignity. And though I am
convinced of the beauty and sincerity and dignity
of Mr. Grierson's soul I cannot kneel down with
him and take part in the performance of his prayer.
Prayer is either the Supreme Illusion, or the Su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>preme
Act, the pure and naked surrender to Reality,
and attended by such sacredness and shyness that
you can accomplish it only when alone or lost in a
multitude that prays.</p>

<p>But why is there no Victoria Cross for moral
courage?</p>

<p>(Dr. Wilson has come. He looks clever and
nice.)</p>

<p>Our restlessness increases.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>11 a.m.</i>]</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> seen one of them. As I went downstairs
this morning, two men carrying a stretcher crossed
the landing below. I saw the outline of the
wounded body under the blanket, and the head laid
back on the pillow.</p>

<p>It is impossible, it is inconceivable, that I should
have been afraid of seeing this. It is as if the
wounded man himself absolved me from the memory
and the reproach of fear.</p>

<p>I stood by the stair-rail to let them pass. There
was some difficulty about turning at the stair-head.
Mr. Riley was there. He came forward and took
one end of the stretcher and turned it. He was
very quiet and very gentle. You could see that he
did the right thing by instinct. And I saw his face,
and knew what had brought him here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>And here on the first landing is another wounded.
His face is deformed by an abscess from a bullet
in his mouth. It gives him a terrible look, half
savage, wholly suffering. He sits there and cannot
speak.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley is the only one of us who has found
anything to do. So presently we go out to get our
military passes. We stroll miserably about the
town, oppressed with a sense of our futility. We
buy cigarettes for the convalescents.</p>

<p>And at noon no orders have come for us.</p>

<p>They come just as we are sitting down to lunch.
Our ambulance car is to go to Alost at once. The
Commandant is arrested in the act of cutting bread.
Dr. Bird is arrested in the act of eating it. We
are all arrested in our several acts. As if they had
been criminal acts, we desist suddenly. The men
get up and look at each other. It is clear that they
cannot all go. Mr. Grierson looks at the Commandant.
His face is a little white and strained,
as it was this morning when he announced Matins
for ten o'clock.</p>

<p>The Commandant looks at Dr. Bird and tells him
that he may go if he likes. His tone is admirably
casual; it conveys no sense of the magnificence of
his renunciation. He looks also at Mr. Grierson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and Mr. Foster. The lot of honour falls upon these
three.</p>

<p>They set out, still with their air of a youthful
picnic party. Dr. Bird is more than ever the boisterous
young man in charge of the champagne.</p>

<p>I am contented so long as Ursula Dearmer and
Mrs. Lambert and Mrs. Torrence and Janet McNeil
and the Commandant do not go yet. To anybody
who knows the Commandant he is bound to be a
prominent figure in the terrible moving pictures
made by fear. Smitten by some great idea, he
dashes out of cover as the shrapnel is falling. He
wanders, wrapped in a happy dream, into the enemies'
trenches. He mingles with their lines of
communication as I have seen him mingle with the
traffic at the junction of Chandos Street and the
Strand. If you were to inform him of a patrol of
Uhlans coming down the road, he would only say,
"I see no Uhlans," and continue in their direction.
It is inconceivable to his optimism that he should
encounter Uhlans in a world so obviously made for
peace and righteousness.</p>

<p>So that it is a relief to see somebody else (whom
I do not know quite so well) going first. Time
enough to be jumpy when the Commandant and the
women go forth on the perilous adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>That is all very well. But I am jumpy all the
same. By the mere fact that they are going out
first Mr. Grierson and Mr. Foster have suddenly
become dear and sacred. Their lives, their persons,
their very clothes&mdash;Dr. Bird's cheerful face, which
is so like an overgrown cherub's, his blond, gold
lock of infantile hair, Mr. Grierson's pale eyes that
foresee danger, his not too well fitting khaki coat&mdash;have
acquired suddenly a priceless value, the
value of things long seen and long admired. It is
as if I had known them all my life; as if life will
be unendurable if they do not come back safe.</p>

<p>It is not very endurable now. Of all the things
that can happen to a woman on a field ambulance,
the worst is to stay behind. To stay behind with
nothing in the world to do but to devise a variety
of dreadful deaths for Tom, the chauffeur, and Dr.
Bird and Mr. Grierson and Mr. Foster. To know
nothing except that Alost is being bombarded and
that it is to Alost that they are going.</p>

<p>And the others who have been left behind are
hanging about in gloom, disgusted with their fate.
Mrs. Torrence and Janet McNeil are beginning to
ask themselves what they are here for. To go
through the wards is only to be in the way of the
angelic beings with red crosses on their breasts and
foreheads who are already somewhat in each other's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
way. Mrs. Torrence and the others do, however,
go into the wards and talk to the wounded and cheer
them up. I sit in the deserted mess-room, and look
at the lunch that Tom and Dr. Bird and Mr. Grierson
should have eaten and were obliged to leave
behind. I would give anything to be able to go
round the wards and cheer the wounded up. I wonder
whether there is anything I could conceivably
do for the wounded that would not bore them inexpressibly
if I were to do it. I frame sentence
after sentence in strange and abominable French,
and each, apart from its own inherent absurdity,
seems a mockery of the wounded. You cannot go
to an immortal hero and grin at him and say <i>Comment
allez-vous?</i> and expect him to be cheered up,
especially when you know yourself to be one of a
long procession of women who have done the same.</p>

<p>I abandon myself to my malady of self-distrust.</p>

<p>It is at its worst when Jean and Max, the convalescent
orderlies, come in to remove the ruins of
our mess. They are pathetic and adorable with
their close-cropped heads in the pallor of their convalescence
(Jean is attired in a suit of yellowish
linen and Max in striped flannels). Jean's pallor
is decorated (there is no other word for it) with
blue-grey eyes, black eyebrows, black eyelashes and
a little black moustache. He is martial and ardent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and alert. But the pallor of Max is unredeemed; it
is morbid and profound. It has invaded his whole
being. His eyelids and his small sensitive mouth
are involved; and his round dark eyes have the
queer grey look of some lamentable wonder and
amazement. But neither horror nor discipline have
spoiled his engaging air&mdash;the air of a very young
<i>collégien</i> who has broken loose and got into this
Military Hospital by mistake.</p>

<p>I do not know whether intuition is a French or
Belgian gift. Jean and Max are not Belgian but
French, and they have it to a marvellous degree.
They seemed to know in an instant what was the
matter with the English lady; and they set about
curing the malady. I have seldom seen such perfect
tact and gentleness as was then displayed by those
two hospital orderlies, Max and Jean. They had
been wounded not so very long ago. But they
think nothing of that. They intimate that if I insist
on helping them with their plates and dishes they
will be wounded, and more severely, in their honour.</p>

<p>We converse.</p>

<p>It is in conversation that they are most adorable.
They gaze at you with candid, innocent eyes; not
a quiver of a lip or an eyelash betrays to you the
outrageous quality of your French. The behaviour
of your sentences would cause a scandal in a private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
boarding school for young ladies, it is so fantastically
incorrect. But Max and Jean receive each
phrase with an imperturbable and charming gravity.
By the subtlest suggestion of manner they assure
you that you speak with fluency and distinction,
that yours is a very perfect French. Only their
severe attentiveness warns you of the strain you are
putting on them.</p>

<p>Max lingered long after Jean had departed to his
kitchen. And presently he gave up his secret. He
is a student, and they took him from his College
(his course unfinished) to fight for his country.
When the War broke out his mother went mad
with the horror of it. He told me this quite simply,
as if he were relating a common incident of war-time.
Then, with a little air of mystery, he signed
to me to follow him along the corridor. He stopped
at a closed door and showed me a name inscribed
in thick ornamental Gothic characters on a card
tacked to the panel:</p>

<p class="figcenterns">
<img src="images/prosper.png" width="200" height="38" alt="Prosper Panne." />
</p>

<p>Max is not his real name. It is the name that
Prosper Panne has taken to disguise himself while
he is a servant. Prosper Panne&mdash;<i>il est écrivain,
journaliste</i>. He writes for the Paris papers. He
looked at me with his amazed, pathetic eyes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
pointed with a finger to his breast to assure me that
he is he, Prosper Panne.</p>

<p>And in the end I asked him whether it would bore
the wounded frightfully if I took them some cigarettes?
(I laid in cigarettes this morning as a provision
for this desolate afternoon.)</p>

<p>And&mdash;dear Prosper Panne&mdash;so thoroughly did
he understand my malady, that he himself escorted
me. It is as if he knew the <i>peur sacré</i> that restrains
me from flinging myself into the presence of the
wounded. Soft-footed and graceful, turning now
and then with his instinct of protection, the orderly
glides before me, smoothing the way between my
shyness and this dreaded majesty of suffering.</p>

<p>I followed him (with my cigarettes in my hand
and my heart in my mouth) into the big ward on the
ground floor.</p>

<p>I don't want to describe that ward, or the effect
of those rows upon rows of beds, those rows upon
rows of bound and bandaged bodies, the intensity
of physical anguish suggested by sheer force of
multiplication, by the diminishing perspective of the
beds, by the clear light and nakedness of the great
hall that sets these repeated units of torture in a
world apart, a world of insufferable space and agonizing
time, ruled by some inhuman mathematics
and given over to pure transcendent pain. A suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ficiently
large ward full of wounded really does
leave an impression very like that. But the one
true thing about this impression is its transcendence.
It is utterly removed from and unlike anything that
you have experienced before. From the moment
that the doors have closed behind you, you are in
another world, and under its strange impact you
are given new senses and a new soul. If there is
horror here you are not aware of it as horror. Before
these multiplied forms of anguish what you
feel&mdash;if there be anything of <i>you</i> left to feel&mdash;is
not pity, because it is so near to adoration.</p>

<p>If you are tired of the burden and malady of
self, go into one of these great wards and you will
find instant release. You and the sum of your little
consciousness are not things that matter any more.
The lowest and the least of these wounded Belgians
is of supreme importance and infinite significance.
You, who were once afraid of them and of their
wounds, may think that you would suffer for them
now, gladly; but you are not allowed to suffer; you
are marvellously and mercilessly let off. In this
sudden deliverance from yourself you have received
the ultimate absolution, and their torment is your
peace.</p>

<p>In the big ward very few of the men were
well enough to smoke. So we went to the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
wards where the convalescents are, Max leading.</p>

<p>I do not think that Max has received absolution
yet. It is quite evident that he is proud of his <i>entrée</i>
into this place and of his intimacy with the wounded,
of his rôle of interpreter.</p>

<p>But how perfectly he does it! He has no Flemish,
but through his subtle gestures even the poor
Flamand, who has no French, understands what I
want to say to him and can't. He turns this modest
presentation of cigarettes into a high social function,
a trifle ambitious, perhaps, but triumphantly
achieved.</p>

<p>All that was over by about three o'clock, when
the sanctuary cast us out, and Max went back to
his empty kitchen and became Prosper Panne again,
and remembered that his mother was mad; and I
went to the empty mess-room and became my miserable
self and remembered that the Field Ambulance
was still out, God knows where.</p>

<p>The mess-room windows look south over the railway
lines towards the country where the fighting is.
From the balcony you can see the lines where the
troop trains run, going north-west and south-east.
The Station, the Post Office, the Telegraph and
Telephone Offices are here, all in one long red-brick
building that bounds one side of the <i>Place</i>. It
stands at right angles to the Flandria and stretches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
along opposite its flank. It has a flat roof with a
crenelated parapet. Grass grows on the roof. No
guns are mounted there, for Ghent is an open city.
But in German tactics bombardment by aeroplane
doesn't seem to count, and our situation is more
provocative now than the Terminus Hotel at Ostend.</p>

<p>Beyond the straight black railway lines are miles
upon miles of flat open country, green fields and
rows of poplars, and little woods, and here and there
a low rise dark with trees. Under our windows the
white street runs south-eastward, and along it scouting
cars and cycling corps rush to the fighting lines,
and military motor-cars hurry impatiently, carrying
Belgian staff officers; the ammunition wagons lumber
along, and the troops march in a long file, to
disappear round the turn of the road. That is
where the others have gone, and I'd give everything
I possess to go with them.</p>

<p>They have come back, incredibly safe, and have
brought in four wounded.</p>

<p>There was a large crowd gathered in the <i>Place</i>
to see them come, a crowd that has nothing to do
and that lives from hour to hour on this spectacle
of the wounded. Intense excitement this time, for
one of the four wounded is a German. He was
lying on a stretcher. No sooner had they drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
him out of the ambulance than they put him back
again. (No Germans are taken in at our Hospital;
they are all sent to the old <i>Hôpital Militaire</i> No. I.)
He thrust up his poor hand and grabbed the hanging
strap to raise himself a little in his stretcher,
and I saw him. He was ruddy and handsome.
His thick blond hair stood up stiff from his forehead.
His little blond moustache was turned up and
twisted fiercely like the Kaiser's. The crowd booed
at him as he lay there. His was a terrible pathos,
unlike any other. He was so defiant and so helpless.
And there's another emotion gone by the
board. You simply could not hate him.</p>

<p>Later in the evening both cars were sent out,
Car No. 1 with the Commandant and, if you will
believe it, Ursula Dearmer. Heavens! What can
the Military Power be thinking of? Car No. 2 took
Dr. Wilson and Mrs. Torrence. The Military
Power, I suppose, has ordained this too. And when
I think of Mrs. Torrence's dream of getting into
the greatest possible danger, I am glad that the
Commandant is with Ursula Dearmer. We pledged
our words, he and I, that danger and Ursula Dearmer
should never meet.</p>

<p>They all come back, impossibly safe. They are
rather like children after the party, too excited to
give a lucid and coherent tale of what they've done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
My ambulance Day-Book stores the stuff from
which reports and newspaper articles are to be made.
I note that Car No. 1 has brought three wounded to
Hospital I., and that Car No. 2 has brought four
wounded to Hospital II., also that a dum-dum
bullet has been found in the hand of one of the
three. There is a considerable stir among the surgeons
over this bullet. They are vaguely gratified
at its being found in our hospital and not the other.</p>

<p>Little Janet McNeil and Mr. Riley and all the
others who were left behind have gone to bed in
hopeless gloom. Even the bullet hasn't roused them
beyond the first tense moment.</p>

<p>I ask for ink, and dear Max has given me all his
in his own ink-pot.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Monday, 28th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have been here a hundred years.</p>

<p>Car No. 1 went out at eight-thirty this morning,
with the Commandant and Dr. Bird and Ursula
Dearmer and Mr. Grierson and a Belgian Red Cross
guide. With Tom, the chauffeur, that makes six.
Tom's face, as he sees this party swarming on his
car, is expressive of tumultuous passions. Disgust
predominates.</p>

<p>Their clothes seem stranger than ever by contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
with the severe military khaki of the car. Dr. Bird
has added to his civilian costume a Belgian forage
cap with a red tassel that hangs over his forehead.
It was given to him yesterday by way of homage to
his courage and his personal charm. But it makes
him horribly vulnerable. The Chaplain, standing
out from the rest of the Corps in complete khaki,
is an even more inevitable mark for bullets. Tom
stares at everybody with eyes of violent inquiry.
He still evidently wants to know whether we call
ourselves a field ambulance. He starts his car with
movements of exasperation and despair. We are to
judge what his sense of discipline must be since he
consents to drive the thing at all.</p>

<p>The Commandant affects not to see Tom. Perhaps
he really doesn't see him.</p>

<p>It is just as well that he can't see Mrs. Torrence,
or Janet McNeil or Mr. Riley or Dr. Haynes.
They are overpowered by this tragedy of being left
behind. Under it the discipline of the &mdash;&mdash; Hospital
breaks down. The eighteen-year-old child is
threatening to commit suicide or else go home. She
regards the two acts as equivalent. Mr. Riley's
gloom is now so awful that he will not speak when
he is spoken to. He looks at me with dumb hostility,
as if he thought that I had something to do
with it. Dr. Haynes's melancholy is even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
heart-rending, because it is gentle and unexpressed.</p>

<p>I try to console them. I point out that it is a
question of arithmetic. There are only two cars
and there are fourteen of us. Fourteen into two
won't go, even if you don't count the wounded.
And, after all, we haven't been here two days. But
it is no good. We have been here a hundred years,
and we have done nothing. There isn't anything
to do. There are not enough wounded to go round.
We turn our eyes with longing towards Antwerp,
so soon to be battered by the siege-guns from
Namur.</p>

<p>And Bert, poor Bert! he has crawled into Ambulance
Car No. 2 where it stands outside in the
hospital yard, and he has hidden himself under the
hood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambert is a little sad, too. But we are
none of us very sorry for Mrs. Lambert. We have
gathered that her husband is a journalist, and that
he is special correspondent at the front for some
American paper. He has a motor-car which we assume
rashly to be the property of his paper. He is
always dashing off to the firing-line in it, and Mrs.
Lambert is always at liberty to go with him. She
is mistaken if she thinks that her sorrow is in any
way comparable with ours.</p>

<p>But if there are not enough wounded to go round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
in Ghent, there are more refugees than Ghent can
deal with. They are pouring in by all the roads
from Alost and Termonde. Every train disgorges
multitudes of them into the <i>Place</i>.</p>

<p>This morning I went to the Matron, Madame F.,
and told her I wasn't much good, but I'd be glad
if she could give me some work. I said I supposed
there was some to be done among the refugees.</p>

<p>Work? Among the refugees? They could employ
whole armies of us. There are thousands of
refugees at the Palais des Fêtes. I had better go
there and see what is being done. Madame will
give me an introduction to her sister-in-law, Madame
F., the Présidente of the Comité des Dames, and
to her niece, Mademoiselle F., who will take me to
the Palais.</p>

<p>And Madame adds that there will soon be work
for all of us in the Hospital. Yes: even for the
untrained.</p>

<p>Life is once more bearable.</p>

<p>But the others won't believe it. They say there
are three hundred nurses in the hospital.</p>

<p>And the fact remains that we have two young
surgeons cooling their heels in the corridors, and
a fully-trained nurse tearing her hair out, while the
young girl, Ursula Dearmer, takes the field.</p>

<p>And I think of the poor little dreamy, guileless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Commandant in his conspicuous car, and I smile at
her in secret, thanking Heaven that it's Ursula
Dearmer and not Mrs. Torrence who is at his side.</p>

<p>The ambulance has come back from Alost with
two or three wounded and some refugees. The
Commandant is visibly elated, elated out of all proportion
to the work actually done. Ursula Dearmer
is not elated in the very least, but she is wide-awake.
Her docility has vanished with her torpor. She and
the Commandant both look as if something extremely
agreeable had happened to them at Alost.
But they are reticent. We gather that Ursula
Dearmer has been working with the nuns in the Convent
at Alost, where the wounded were taken before
the ambulance cars removed them to Ghent. It
sounded very safe.</p>

<p>But the Commandant dashed into my room after
luncheon. His face was radiant, almost ecstatic.
He was like a child who has rushed in to tell you
how ripping the pantomime was.</p>

<p>"We've been <i>under fire</i>!"</p>

<p>But I was very angry. Coldly and quietly
angry. I felt like that when I was ten years old
and piloting my mother through the thick of the
traffic between Guildhall and the Bank, and she
broke from me and was all but run over. I don't
quite know what I said to him, but I think I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
he ought to be ashamed of himself. For it seems
that Ursula Dearmer was with him.</p>

<p>I remembered how Ursula Dearmer's mother had
come to me in the committee-room and asked me
how near we proposed to go to the firing-line, and
whether her daughter would be in any danger, and
how I said, first of all, that there wasn't any use
pretending that there wouldn't be danger, and that
the chances were&mdash;and how the Commandant had
intervened at that moment to assure her that danger
there would be none. With a finger on the map of
France and Belgium he traced the probable, the inevitable,
course of the campaign; and in light, casual
tones which allayed all anxiety, he explained how, as
the Germans advanced upon any point, we should
retire upon our base. As for the actual field-work,
with one gesture he swept the whole battle-line into
the distance, and you saw it as an infinitely receding
tide that left its wrack strewn on a place of peace
where the ambulance wandered at its will, secure
from danger. The whole thing was done with such
compelling and convincing enthusiasm that Ursula
Dearmer's mother adopted more and more the humble
attitude of a mere woman who has failed to
grasp the conditions of modern warfare. Ursula
Dearmer herself looked more docile than ever,
though a little bored, and very sleepy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>And I remembered how when it was all over
Ursula Dearmer's mother implored me, if there <i>was</i>
any danger, to see that Ursula Dearmer was sent
home, and how I promised that whatever happened
Ursula Dearmer would be safe, clinching it with a
frightfully sacred inner vow, and saying to myself
at the same time what a terrible nuisance this young
girl is going to be. I saw myself at the moment of
parting, standing on the hearthrug, stiff as a poker
with resolution, and saying solemnly, "I'll keep
my word!"</p>

<p>And here was the Commandant informing me
with glee that a shell had fallen and burst at Ursula
Dearmer's feet.</p>

<p>He was so pleased, and with such innocent and
childlike pleasure, that I hadn't the heart to tell him
that there wasn't much resemblance between those
spaces of naked peace behind the receding battle-line
and the narrow streets of a bombarded village. I
only said that I should write to Ursula Dearmer's
mother and ask her to release me from my promise.
He said I would do nothing of the kind. I said I
would. And I did. And the poor Commandant
left me, somewhat dashed, and not at all pleased
with me.</p>

<p>It seems that the shell burst, not exactly at Ursula
Dearmer's feet, but ten yards away from her. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
came romping down the street with immense impetus
and determination; and it is not said of Ursula
Dearmer that she was much less coy in the encounter.
She took to shell-fire "like a duck to water."</p>

<p>Dr. Bird told us this. Ursula Dearmer herself
was modest, and claimed no sort of intimacy with
the shell that waked her up. She was as nice as
possible about it. But all the same, into the whole
Corps (that part of it that had been left behind)
there has crept a sneaking envy of her luck. I feel
it myself. And if <i>I</i> feel it, what must Mrs. Torrence
and Janet feel?</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambert, anyhow, has had nothing to complain
of so far. Her husband took her to Alost in
his motor-car; I mean the motor-car which is the
property of his paper.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mademoiselle F. called to take
me to the Palais des Fêtes. We stopped at a shop
on the way to buy the Belgian Red Cross uniform&mdash;the
white linen overall and veil&mdash;which you
must wear if you work among the refugees there.</p>

<p>Madame F. is very kind and very tired. She has
been working here since early morning for weeks
on end. They are short of volunteers for the service
of the evening meals, and I am to work at the
tables for three hours, from six to nine <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> This
is settled, and a young Red Cross volunteer takes me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
over the Palais. It is an immense building, rather
like Olympia. It stands away from the town in
open grounds like the Botanical Gardens, Regent's
Park. It is where the great Annual Shows were
held and the vast civic entertainments given. Miles
of country round Ghent are given up to market-gardening.
There are whole fields of begonias out
here, brilliant and vivid in the sun. They will never
be sold, never gathered, never shown in the Palais
des Fêtes. It is the peasants, the men and women
who tilled these fields, and their children that are
being shown here, in the splendid and wonderful
place where they never set foot before.</p>

<p>There are four thousand of them lying on straw
in the outer hall, in a space larger than Olympia.
They are laid out in rows all round the four walls,
and on every foot of ground between; men, women
and children together, packed so tight that there is
barely standing-room between any two of them.
Here and there a family huddles up close, trying to
put a few inches between it and the rest; some have
hollowed out a place in the straw or piled a barrier
of straw between themselves and their neighbours,
in a piteous attempt at privacy; some have dragged
their own bedding with them and are lodged in comparative
comfort. But these are the very few.
The most part are utterly destitute, and utterly aban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>doned
to their destitution. They are broken with
fatigue. They have stumbled and dropped no matter
where, no matter beside whom. None turns
from his neighbour; none scorns or hates or loathes
his fellow. The rigidly righteous <i>bourgeoise</i> lies in
the straw breast to breast with the harlot of the
village slum, and her innocent daughter back to back
with the parish drunkard. Nothing matters.
Nothing will ever matter any more.</p>

<p>They tell you that when darkness comes down
on all this there is hell. But you do not believe it.
You can see nothing sordid and nothing ugly here.
The scale is too vast. Your mind refuses this coupling
of infamy with transcendent sorrow. It rejects
all images but the one image of desolation which is
final and supreme. It is as if these forms had no
stability and no significance of their own; as if they
were locked together in one immense body and
stirred or slept as one.</p>

<p>Two or three figures mount guard over this litter
of prostrate forms. They are old men and old
women seated on chairs. They sit upright and immobile,
with their hands folded on their knees.
Some of them have fallen asleep where they sit.
They are all rigid in an attitude of resignation.
They have the dignity of figures that will endure,
like that, for ever. They are Flamands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>This place is terribly still. There is hardly any
rustling of the straw. Only here and there the cry
of a child fretting for sleep or for its mother's
breast. These people do not speak to each other.
Half of them are sound asleep, fixed in the posture
they took when they dropped into the straw. The
others are drowsed with weariness, stupefied with
sorrow. On all these thousands of faces there is a
mortal apathy. Their ruin is complete. They have
been stripped bare of the means of life and of all
likeness to living things. They do not speak.
They do not think. They do not, for the moment,
feel. In all the four thousand&mdash;except for the
child crying yonder&mdash;there is not one tear.</p>

<p>And you who look at them cannot speak or think
or feel either, and you have not one tear. A path
has been cleared through the straw from door to
door down the middle of the immense hall, a narrower
track goes all round it in front of the litters
that are ranged under the walls, and you are taken
through and round the Show. You are to see it
all. The dear little Belgian lady, your guide, will
not let you miss anything. "<i>Regardez, Mademoiselle,
ces deux petites filles. Qu'elles sont jolies,
les pauvres petites.</i>" "<i>Voici deux jeunes mariés,
qui dorment. Regardez l'homme; il tient encore la
main de sa femme.</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>You look. Yes. They are asleep. He is really
holding her hand. "<i>Et ces quatre petits enfants
qui ont perdu leur père et leur mère. C'est triste,
n'est-ce pas, Mademoiselle?</i>"</p>

<p>And you say, "<i>Oui, Mademoiselle. C'est bien
triste.</i>"</p>

<p>But you don't mean it. You don't feel it. You
don't know whether it is "<i>triste</i>" or not. You are
not sure that "<i>triste</i>" is the word for it. There are
no words for it, because there are no ideas for it.
It is a sorrow that transcends all sorrow that you
have ever known. You have a sort of idea that perhaps,
if you can ever feel again, this sight will be
worse to remember than it is to see. You can't believe
what you see; you are stunned, stupefied, as if
you yourself had been crushed and numbed in the
same catastrophe. Only now and then a face upturned
(a face that your guide hasn't pointed out
to you) surging out of this incredible welter of
faces and forms, smites you with pity, and you
feel as if you had received a lacerating wound in
sleep.</p>

<p>Little things strike you, though. Already you are
forgetting the faces of the two little girls and of
the young husband and wife holding each other's
hands, and of the four little children who have lost
their father and mother, but you notice the little dog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the yellow-brown mongrel terrier, that absurd little
dog which belongs to all nations and all countries.
He has obtained possession of the warm centre of a
pile of straw and is curled up on it fast asleep. And
the Flemish family who brought him, who carried
him in turn for miles rather than leave him to the
Germans, they cannot stretch themselves on the
straw because of him. They have propped themselves
up as best they may all round him, and they
cannot sleep, they are too uncomfortable.</p>

<p>More thousands than there is room for in the
straw are fed three times a day in the inner hall,
leading out of this dreadful dormitory. All round
the inner hall and on the upper story off the gallery
are rooms for washing and dressing the children
and for bandaging sore feet and attending to the
wounded. For there are many wounded among
the refugees. This part of the Palais is also a hospital,
with separate wards for men, for women and
children and for special cases.</p>

<p>Late in the evening M. P&mdash;&mdash; took the whole
Corps to see the Palais des Fêtes, and I went again.
By night I suppose it is even more "<i>triste</i>" than it
was by day. In the darkness the gardens have
taken on some malign mystery and have given it to
the multitudes that move there, that turn in the
winding paths among ghostly flowers and bushes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
that approach and recede and approach in the darkness
of the lawns. Blurred by the darkness and
diminished to the barest indications of humanity,
their forms are more piteous and forlorn than ever;
their faces, thrown up by the darkness, more awful
in their blankness and their pallor. The scene,
drenched in darkness, is unearthly and unintelligible.
You cannot account for it in saying to yourself that
these are the refugees, and everybody knows what
a refugee is; that there is War&mdash;and everybody
knows what war is&mdash;in Belgium; and that these
people have been shelled out of their homes and are
here at the Palais des Fêtes, because there is no
other place for them, and the kind citizens of Ghent
have undertaken to house and feed them here.
That doesn't make it one bit more credible or bring
you nearer to the secret of these forms. You who
are compelled to move with them in the sinister darkness
are more than ever under the spell that forbids
you and them to feel. You are deadened now to
the touch of the incarnate.</p>

<p>On the edge of the lawn, near the door of the
Palais, some ghostly roses are growing on a ghostly
tree. Your guide, M. P&mdash;&mdash;, pauses to tell you
their names and kind. It seems that they are
rare.</p>

<p>Several hundred more refugees have come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the Palais since the afternoon. They have had to
pack them a little closer in the straw. Eight thousand
were fed this evening in the inner hall.</p>

<p>In the crush I get separated from M. P&mdash;&mdash; and
from the Corps. I see some of them in the distance,
the Commandant and Ursula Dearmer and Mrs.
Lambert and M. P&mdash;&mdash;. I do not feel as if I belonged
to them any more. I belong so much to the
stunned sleepers in the straw who cannot feel.</p>

<p>Nice Dr. Wilson comes across to me and we go
round together, looking at the sleepers. He says
that nothing he has seen of the War has moved him
so much as this sight. He wishes that the Kaiser
could be brought here to see what he has done. And
I find myself clenching my hands tight till it hurts,
not to suppress my feelings&mdash;for I feel nothing&mdash;but
because I am afraid that kind Dr. Wilson is
going to talk. At the same time, I would rather
he didn't leave me just yet. There is a sort of comfort
and protection in being with somebody who
isn't callous, who can really feel.</p>

<p>But Dr. Wilson isn't very fluent, and presently he
leaves off talking, too.</p>

<p>Near the door we pass the family with the little
yellow-brown dog. All day the little dog slept in
their place. And now that they are trying to sleep
he will not let them. The little dog is wide awake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and walking all over them. And when you think
what it must have cost to bring him&mdash;</p>

<p><i>C'est triste, n'est-ce pas?</i></p>

<p>As we left the gardens M. P&mdash;&mdash; gathered two
ghostly roses, the last left on their tree, and gave
one to Mrs. Lambert and one to me. I felt something
rather like a pang then. Heaven knows why,
for such a little thing.</p>

<p>Conference in our mess-room. M. &mdash;&mdash;, the
Belgian Red Cross guide who goes out with our
ambulances, is there. He is very serious and important.
The Commandant calls us to come and hear
what he has to say. It seems it had been arranged
that one of our cars should be sent to-morrow morning
to Termonde to bring back refugees. But M.
&mdash;&mdash; does not think that car will ever start. He
says that the Germans are now within a few miles
of Ghent, and may be expected to occupy it to-morrow
morning, and that instead of going to Termonde
to-morrow we had very much better pack up and retreat
to Bruges to-night. There are ten thousand
Germans ready to march into Ghent.</p>

<p>M. &mdash;&mdash; is weighed down by the thought of his
ten thousand Germans. But the Commandant is
not weighed down a bit. On the contrary, a pleasant
exaltation comes upon him. It comes upon the
whole Corps, it comes even upon me. We refuse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
believe in his ten thousand Germans. M. &mdash;&mdash; himself
cannot swear to them. We refuse to pack up.
We refuse to retreat to Bruges to-night. Time
enough for agitation in the morning. We prefer to
go to bed. M. &mdash;&mdash; shrugs his shoulders, as much
as to say that he has done his duty and if we are all
murdered in our beds it isn't his fault.</p>

<p>Does M. &mdash;&mdash; really believe in the advance of the
ten thousand? His face is inscrutable.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Tuesday, 29th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> Germans in Ghent. No Germans reported
near Ghent.</p>

<p>Madame F. and her daughter smile at the idea
of the Germans coming into Ghent. They will
never come, and if they do come they will only take
a little food and go out again. They will never do
any harm to Ghent. Namur and Liége and Brussels,
if you like, and Malines, and Louvain, and
Termonde and Antwerp (perhaps); but Ghent&mdash;why
should they? It is Antwerp they are making
for, not Ghent.</p>

<p>And Madame represents the mind of the average
Gantois. It is placid, incredulous, stolidly at ease,
superbly inhospitable to disagreeable ideas. No
Gantois can conceive that what has been done to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
citizens of Termonde would be done to him. <i>C'est
triste</i>&mdash;what has been done to the citizens of Termonde,
but it doesn't shake his belief in the immunity
of Ghent.</p>

<p>Which makes M. &mdash;&mdash;'s behaviour all the more
mysterious. <i>Why</i> did he try to scare us so? Five
theories are tenable:</p>

<p>(1.) M. &mdash;&mdash; did honestly believe that ten thousand
Germans would come in the morning and take
our ambulance prisoner. That is to say, he believed
what nobody else believed.</p>

<p>(2.) M. &mdash;&mdash; was scared himself. He had no
desire to be taken quite so near the firing-line as the
English Ambulance seemed likely to take him; so
that the departure of the English Ambulance would
not be wholly disagreeable to M. &mdash;&mdash;. (This
theory is too far-fetched.)</p>

<p>(3.) M. &mdash;&mdash; was the agent of the Military
Power, commissioned to test the nerve of the English
Ambulance. ("Stood fire, have they? Give
'em a <i>real</i> scare, and see how they behave.")</p>

<p>(4.) M. &mdash;&mdash; is a psychologist and made this little
experiment on the English Ambulance himself.</p>

<p>(5.) He is a humorist and was simply "pulling
its leg."</p>

<p>The three last theories are plausible, but all five
collapse before the inscrutability of Monsieur's face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Germans or no Germans, one ambulance car
started at five in the morning for Quatrecht, somewhere
between Ghent and Brussels, to fetch
wounded and refugees. The other went, later, to
Zele. I am not very clear as to who has gone with
them, but Mrs. Torrence, Mrs. Lambert, Janet McNeil
and Dr. Haynes and Mr. Riley have been left
behind.</p>

<p>It is their third day of inactivity, and three months
of it could not have devastated them more. They
have touched the very bottom of suicidal gloom.
Three months hence their state of mind will no
doubt appear in all its absurdity, but at the moment
it is too piteous for words. When you think what
they were yesterday and the day before, there is no
language to express the crescendo of their despair.
I came upon Mr. Riley this morning, standing by
the window of the mess-room, and contemplating the
façade of the railway station. (It is making a pattern
on our brains.) I tried to soothe him. I said
it was hard lines&mdash;beastly hard lines&mdash;and told
him to cheer up&mdash;there'd be heaps for him to do
presently. And he turned from me like a man who
has just buried his first-born.</p>

<p>Janet McNeil is even more heart-rending, sunk
in a chair with her hands stuck into the immense
pockets of her overcoat, her flawless and impassive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
face tilted forward as her head droops forlornly to
her breast. She is such a child that she can see
nothing beyond to-day, and yesterday and the day
before that. She is going back to-morrow. Her
valour and energy are frustrated and she is wounded
in her honour. She is conscious of the rottenness
of putting on a khaki tunic, and winding khaki putties
round and round her legs to hang about the Hospital
doing nothing. And she had to sell her motor
bicycle in order to come out. Not that that matters
in the least. What matters is that we are here, eating
Belgian food and quartered in a Belgian Military
Hospital, and "swanking" about with Belgian
Red Cross brassards (stamped) on our sleeves, and
doing nothing for the Belgians, doing nothing for
anybody. We are not justifying our existence.
We are frauds.</p>

<p>I tell the poor child that she cannot possibly feel
as big a fraud as I do; that there was no earthly
reason why I should have come, and none whatever
why I should remain.</p>

<p>And then, to my amazement, I learn that I am
envied. It's all right for me. My job is clearly
defined, and nobody can take it from me. I haven't
got to wind khaki putties round my legs for nothing.</p>

<p>I should have thought that the child was making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
jokes at my expense but for the extreme purity and
candour of her gaze. Incredible that there should
exist an abasement profounder than my own. I
have hidden my tunic and breeches in my hold-all.
I dare not own to having brought them.</p>

<p>Down in the vestibule I encounter Mrs. Torrence
in khaki. Mrs. Torrence yearning for her wounded.
Mrs. Torrence determined to get to her wounded
at any cost. She is not abased or dejected, but exalted,
rather. She is ready to go to the President
or to the Military Power itself, and demand her
wounded from them. Her beautiful eyes demand
them from Heaven itself.</p>

<p>I cannot say there are not enough wounded to
go round, but I point out for the fifteenth time that
the trouble is there are not enough ambulance cars
to go round.</p>

<p>But it is no use. It does not explain why Heaven
should have chosen Ursula Dearmer and caused
shells to bound in her direction, and have rejected
Mrs. Torrence. The Military Power that should
have ordered these things has abandoned us to the
caprice of Heaven.</p>

<p>Of course if Mrs. Torrence was a saint she would
fold her hands and bow her superb little head before
the decrees of Heaven; but she is only a mortal
woman, born with the genius of succour and trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to the last point of efficiency; so she rages. The
tigress, robbed of her young, is not more furiously
inconsolable than Mrs. Torrence.</p>

<p>It is not Ursula Dearmer's fault. She is innocent
of supplanting Mrs. Torrence. The thing simply
happened. More docile than determined, unhurrying
and uneager, and only half-awake, she
seems to have rolled into Car No. 1 with Heaven's
impetus behind her. Like the shell at Alost, it is
her luck.</p>

<p>And on the rest of us our futility and frustration
weigh like lead. The good Belgian food has become
bitter in our mouths. When we took our miserable
walk through Ghent this morning we felt that
<i>l'Ambulance Anglaise</i> must be a mark for public
hatred and derision because of us. I declare I
hardly dare go into the shops with the Red Cross
brassard on my arm. I imagine sardonic raillery in
the eyes of every Belgian that I meet. We do not
think the authorities will stand it much longer; they
will fire us out of the <i>Hôpital Militaire</i> No. II.</p>

<p>But no, the authorities do not fire us out. Impassive
in wisdom and foreknowledge, they smile
benignly on our agitation. They compliment the
English Ambulance on the work it has done already.
They convey the impression that but for the English
Ambulance the Belgian Army would be in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
bad way. Mademoiselle F. insists that the Hospital
will soon be overflowing with the wounded from
Antwerp and that she can find work even for me.
It is untrue that there are three hundred nurses in
the Hospital. There are only three hundred nurses in
all Belgium. They pile it on so that we are more
depressed than ever.</p>

<p>Janet McNeil is convinced that they think we are
no good and that they are just being angels to us
because they are sorry for us.</p>

<p>I break it to them very gently that I've volunteered
to serve at the tables at the Palais des Fêtes.
I feel as if I had sneaked into a remunerative job
while my comrades are starving.</p>

<p>The Commandant is not quite as pleased as I
thought he would be to hear of my engagement at
the Palais des Fêtes. He says, "It is not your
work." I insist that my work is to do anything I
can do; and that if I cannot dress wounds I can at
least hand round bread and pour out coffee and wash
up dishes. It is true that I am Secretary and Reporter
and (for the time being) Treasurer to the
Ambulance, and that I carry its funds in a leather
purse belt round my body. Because I am the smallest
and weakest member of the Corps that is the
most unlikely place for the funds to be. It was imprudent,
to say the least of it, for the Chaplain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
his khaki, to carry them, as he did, into the firing-line.
The belt, which fitted the Chaplain, hangs
about half a yard below my waist and is extremely
uncomfortable, but that is neither here nor there.
Keeping the Corps' accounts only takes two hours
and a half, even with Belgian and English money
mixed, and when I've added the same column of
figures ten times up and ten times down, to make
certain it's all right (I am no good at accounts, but
I know my weakness and guard against it, giving the
Corps the benefit of every doubt and making good
every deficit out of my private purse). Writing the
Day-Book&mdash;perhaps half an hour. The Commandant's
correspondence, when he has any, and
reporting to the British Red Cross Society, when
there is anything to report, another half-hour at the
outside; and there you have only three and a half
hours employed out of the twenty-four, even if I
balanced my accounts every day, and I don't.</p>

<p>True that <i>The Daily Chronicle</i> promised to take
any articles that I might send them from the front,
but I haven't written any. You cannot write articles
for <i>The Daily Chronicle</i> out of nothing; at
least I can't.</p>

<p>The Commandant finally yields to argument and
entreaty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>I do not tell him that what I really want to do is
to go out with the Field Ambulance, and get beyond
the turn of that road.</p>

<p>I know I haven't the ghost of a chance; I know
that if I had&mdash;as things stand at present&mdash;not being
a surgeon or a trained nurse, I wouldn't take it,
even to get there. And at the same time I know,
with a superior certainty, that this unlikely thing
will happen. This sense of certainty is not at all
uncommon, but it is, or seems, unintelligible. You
can only conceive it as a premonition of some unavoidable
event. It is as if something had been
looking for you, waiting for you, from all eternity
out here; something that you have been looking for;
and, when you are getting near, it begins calling to
you; it draws your heart out to it all day long.
You can give no account of it. All that you know
about it is that it is unique. It has nothing to do
with your ordinary curiosities and interests and
loves; nothing to do with the thirst for experience,
or for adventure, or for glory, or for the thrill.
You can't "get" anything out of it. It is something
hidden and secret and supremely urgent. Its
urgency, indeed, is so great that if you miss it you
will have missed reality itself.</p>

<p>For me this uncanny anticipation is somehow connected
with the turn of the south-east road. I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
not see how I am ever going to get there or anywhere
near there. But I am not uneasy or impatient
any more. There is no hurry. The thing,
whatever it is, will be irresistible, and if I don't go
out to find it, it will find me.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence has gone, Heaven knows where.
She has not been with the others at the Palais des
Fêtes. Janet McNeil and Mrs. Lambert have been
working there for five hours, serving meals to the
refugees. Ursula Dearmer with extreme docility
has been working all the afternoon with the nurses.</p>

<p>It looks as if we were beginning to settle
down.</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence has come back. The red German
pom-pom has gone from her cap and she wears the
badge of the Belgian Motor Cyclist Corps, black
wings on a white ground. Providence has rehabilitated
himself. He has abased our trained nurse and
expert motorist in order to exalt her. He fairly
flung her in the path of the Colonel of (I think)
the Belgian Motor Cyclist Corps at a moment when
the Colonel found himself in a jibbing motor-car
without a chauffeur. We gather that the Colonel
was becoming hectic with blasphemy when she appeared
and settled the little difficulty between him
and his car. She seems to have followed it up by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
driving him then and there straight up to the firing-line
to look for wounded.</p>

<p>End of the adventure&mdash;she volunteered her services
as chauffeur to the Colonel and was accepted.</p>

<p>The Commandant has received the news with imperturbable
optimism.</p>

<p>As for her, she is appeased. She will realize her
valorous dream of "the greatest possible danger;"
and she will get to her wounded.</p>

<p>The others have come back too. They have toiled
for five hours among the refugees.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>5.30.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is my turn now at the Palais des Fêtes.</p>

<p>It took ages to get in. The dining-hall is narrower
than the sleeping-hall, but it extends beyond
it on one side where there is a large door opening
on the garden. But this door is closed to the public.
You can only reach the dining-hall by going through
the straw among the sleepers. And at this point the
Commandant's optimism has broken down. He
won't let you go in through the straw, and the clerk
who controls the entry won't let you go in through
the other door. You explain to the clerk that the
English Ambulance being quartered in a Military
Hospital, its rules are inviolable; it is not allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
expose itself to the horrors of the straw. The clerk
is not interested in the English Ambulance, he is
not impressed by the fact that it has volunteered its
priceless services to the Refugee Committee, and he
is contemptuous of the orders of its Commandant.
His business is to see that you go into the Palais
through <i>his</i> door and not through any other door.
And when you tell him that if he will not withdraw
his regulations the Ambulance will be compelled to
withdraw its services, he replies with delicious sarcasm,
"<i>Nous n'avons pas prévu ça</i>."
In the end you are referred to the Secretary in
his bureau. He grasps the situation and is urbanity
itself. Provided with a special permit bearing his
sacred signature, you are admitted by the other
door.</p>

<p>Your passage to the <i>Vestiaire</i> takes you through
the infants' room and along the galleries past the
wards. The crowd of refugees is so great that beds
have been put up in the galleries. You take off your
outer garments and put on the Belgian Red Cross
uniform (you have realized by this time that your
charming white overall and veil are sanitary precautions).</p>

<p>Coming down the wide wooden stairways you
have a full view of the Inner Hall. This enormous
oblong space below the galleries is the heart, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
fervid central <i>foyer</i> of the Palais des Fêtes. At
either end of it is an immense auditorium, tier above
tier of seats, rising towards the gallery floors. All
down each side of it, standards with triumphal devices
are tilted from the balustrade. Banners hang
from the rafters.</p>

<p>And under them, down the whole length of the
hall from auditorium to auditorium, the tables are
set out. Bare wooden tables, one after another,
more tables than you can count.</p>

<p>From the door of the sleeping-hall to each auditorium,
and from each auditorium down the line of
the tables a gangway is roped off for the passage of
the refugees.</p>

<p>They say there are ten thousand five hundred here
to-night. Beyond the rope-line, along the inner hall,
more straw has been laid down to bed the overflow
from the outer hall. They come on in relays to be
fed. They are marshalled first into the seats of
each auditorium, where they sit like the spectators
of some monstrous festival and wait for their turn
at the tables.</p>

<p>This, the long procession of people streaming in
without haste, in perfect order and submission, is
heart-rending if you like. The immensity of the
crowd no longer overpowers you. The barriers
make it a steady procession, a credible spectacle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
You can take it in. It is the thin end of the wedge in
your heart. They come on so slowly that you can
count them as they come. They have sorted themselves
out. The fathers and the mothers are together,
they lead their little children by the hand or
push them gently before them. There is no anticipation
in their eyes; no eagerness and no impatience
in their bearing. They do not hustle each other or
scramble for their places. It is their silence and
submission that you cannot stand.</p>

<p>For you have a moment of dreadful inactivity
after the setting of the tables for the <i>premier service</i>.
You have filled your bowls with black coffee; somebody
else has laid the slices of white bread on the
bare tables. You have nothing to do but stand still
and see them file in to the banquet. On the banners
and standards from the roof and balustrades the
Lion of Flanders ramps over their heads. And
somewhere in the back of your brain a song sings
itself to a tune that something in your brain wakes
up:</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>Ils ne vont pas dompter<br />
Le vieux lion de Flandres,<br />
Tant que le lion a des dents,<br />
Tant que le lion peut griffer.</i></p>

<p>It is the song the Belgian soldiers sang as they
marched to battle in the first week of August. It
is only the end of September now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>And somebody standing beside you says: "<i>C'est
triste, n'est-ce pas?</i>"</p>

<p>You cannot look any more.</p>

<p>At the canteen the men are pouring out coffee
from enormous enamelled jugs into the small jugs
that the waitresses bring. This wastes your time
and cools the coffee. So you take a big jug from
the men. It seems to you no heavier than an ordinary
teapot. And you run with it. To carry the
largest possible jug at the swiftest possible pace is
your only chance of keeping sane. (It isn't till it
is all over that you hear the whisper of "<i>Anglaise!</i>"
and realize how very far from sane you must have
looked running round with your enormous jug.)
You can fill up the coffee bowls again&mdash;the little
bowls full, the big bowls only half full; there is
more than enough coffee to go round. But there is
no milk except for the babies. And when they ask
you for more bread there is not enough to go twice
round. The ration is now two slices of dry bread
and a bowl of black coffee three times a day. Till
yesterday there was an allowance of meat for soup
at the mid-day meal; to-day the army has commandeered
all the meat.</p>

<p>But you needn't stand still any more. After the
first service the bowls have to be cleared from the
tables and washed and laid ready for the next.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Round the great wooden tubs there is a frightful
competition. It is who can wash and dry and carry
back the quickest. You contend with brawny
Flemish women for the first dip into the tub and the
driest towel. Then you race round the tables with
your pile of crockery, and then with your jug, and
so on over and over again for three hours, till the last
relay is fed and the tables are deserted. You wash
up again and it is all over for you till six o'clock to-morrow
evening.</p>

<p>You go back to your mess-room and a ten-o'clock
supper of cold coffee and sandwiches and Belgian
current loaf eaten with butter. And in a nightmare
afterwards Belgian refugees gather round you
and pluck at your sleeve and cry to you for more
bread: "<i>Une petite tranche de pain, s'il vous plaît,
mademoiselle!</i>"</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Wednesday, 30th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> Germans, nor sign of Germans yet.</p>

<p>Fighting is reported at Saint Nicolas, between
Antwerp and Ghent. The Commandant has an
idea. He says that if the Belgian Army has to meet
the Germans at Saint Nicolas, so as to cut off their
advance on Antwerp, the base hospital must be removed
from Ghent to some centre or point which
will bring the Ambulance behind the Belgian lines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
He thinks that working from Ghent would necessarily
bring it behind the German lines. This is
assuming that the Germans coming up from the
south-east will cut in between Saint Nicolas and
Ghent.</p>

<p>He consults the President, who apparently thinks
that the base hospital will do very well where it is.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>2.30.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Torrence</span> brought her Colonel in to lunch.
He is battered and grizzled, but still a fine figure
in the dark-green uniform of the Motor Cyclist
Corps. He is very polite and gallant <i>à la belge</i> and
vows that he has taken on Mrs. Torrence <i>pour toujours,
pour la vie</i>! She diverts the flow of urbanity
adroitly.</p>

<p>Except the Colonel nothing noteworthy seems to
have occurred to-day. The three hours at the Palais
des Fêtes were like the three hours last night.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Thursday, October 1st.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> really isn't safe for the Commandant to go out
with Ursula Dearmer. For her luck in the matter
of bombardments continues. (He might just as
well be with Mrs. Torrence.) They have been at
Termonde. What is more, it was Ursula Dearmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
who got them through, in spite of the medical military
officer whose vigorous efforts stopped them at
the barrier. He seems at one point to have shown
weakness and given them leave to go on a little way
up the road; and the little way seems to have carried
them out of his sight and onward till they encountered
the Colonel (or it may have been a General)
in command. The Colonel (or the General) seems
to have broken down very badly, for the car and
Ursula Dearmer and the Commandant went on towards
Termonde. Young Haynes was with them
this time, and on the way they had picked up Mr.
G. L&mdash;&mdash;, War Correspondent to the <i>Daily Mail</i> and
<i>Westminster</i>. They left the car behind somewhere
in a safe place where the fire from the machine-guns
couldn't reach it. There is a street or a road&mdash;I
can't make out whether it is inside or outside the
town; it leads straight to the bridge over the river,
which is about as wide there as the Thames at Westminster.
The bridge is the key to the position; it has
been blown up and built again several times in the
course of the War, and the Germans are now entrenched
beyond it. The road had been raked by
their <i>mitrailleuses</i> the day before.</p>

<p>It seems to have struck the four simultaneously
that it would be quite a good thing to walk
down this road on the off-chance of the machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>-guns
opening fire again. The tale told by the Commandant
evokes an awful vision of them walking
down it, four abreast, the Commandant and Mr. G.
L&mdash;&mdash; on the outside, fairly under shelter, and
Ursula Dearmer and young Haynes a little in front
of them down the middle, where the fire comes, when
it does come. This spectacle seems to have shaken
the Commandant in his view of bombarded towns
as suitable places of amusement for young girls.
Young Haynes ought to have known better. You
tell him that as long as the world endures young
Haynes will be young Haynes, and if there is danger
in the middle of the road, it is there that he will
walk by preference. And as no young woman of
modern times is going to let herself be outdone by
young Haynes, you must expect to find Ursula Dearmer
in the middle of the road too. You cannot suppress
this competitive heroism of young people.
The roots strike too deep down in human nature.
In the modern young man and woman competitive
heroism has completely forgotten its origin and is
now an end in itself.</p>

<p>And if it comes to that&mdash;how about Alost?</p>

<p>At the mention of Alost the Commandant's face
becomes childlike again in its utter simplicity and
innocence and candour. Alost was a very different
thing. Looking for shells at Alost, you understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
was like looking for shells on the seashore. At
Alost Ursula Dearmer was in no sort of danger.
For at Alost she was under the Commandant's wing
(young Haynes hasn't got any wings, only legs to
walk into the line of fire on). He explains very
carefully that he took her under his wing <i>because</i> she
is a young girl and he feels responsible for her to her
mother.</p>

<p>(Which, oddly enough, is just how <i>I</i> feel!)</p>

<p>As for young Haynes, I suppose he would plead
that when he and Ursula Dearmer walked down the
middle of the road there was no firing.</p>

<p>That seems to have been young Haynes's particular
good fortune. I have now a perfect obsession
of responsibility. I see, in one dreadful vision
after another, the things that must happen to Ursula
Dearmer under the Commandant's wing, and to
young Haynes and the Commandant under Ursula
Dearmer's.</p>

<p>No wounded were found, this time, at Termonde.</p>

<p>This little <i>contretemps</i> with the Commandant has
made me forget to record a far more notable event.
Mrs. Torrence brought young Lieutenant G&mdash;&mdash; in
to luncheon. He is the hero of the Belgian Motor
Cyclist Corps. He is said to have accounted for
nine Germans with his own rifle in one morning.
The Corps has already intimated that this is the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
well-defined specimen of a man it has yet seen in
Belgium. His dark-green uniform fits him exceedingly
well. He is tall and handsome. Drenched in
the glamour of the greatest possible danger, he gives
it off like a subtle essence. As he was led in he had
rather the air, the slightly awkward, puzzled and embarrassed
air, of being on show as a fine specimen of
a man. But it very soon wore off. In the absence
of the Commandant he sat in the Commandant's
place, so magnificent a figure that our mess, with
gaps at every table, looked like a banquet given in
his honour, a banquet whose guests had been decimated
by some catastrophe.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;whether it was the presence of the
Lieutenant or the absence of the Commandant, or
merely reaction from the strain of inactivity, I don't
know, but suddenly madness came upon our mess.
The mess-room was no longer a mess-room in a Military
Hospital, but a British school-room. Mrs. Torrence
had changed her woollen cap for a grey felt
wide-awake. She was no longer an Arctic explorer,
but the wild-western cowboy of British melodrama.
She was the first to go mad. One moment she was
seated decorously at the Lieutenant's right hand; the
next she was strolling round the tables with an air
of innocent abstraction, having armed herself in
secret with the little hard round rolls supplied by or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>der
of the Commandant. Each little roll became a
deadly <i>obus</i> in her hand. She turned. Her innocent
abstraction was intense as she poised herself to
aim.</p>

<p>With a shout of laughter Dr. Bird ducked behind
the cover of his table-napkin.</p>

<p>I had a sudden memory of Mrs. Torrence in command
of the party at Ostend, a figure of austere
duty, of inexorable propriety, rigid with the discipline
of the &mdash;&mdash; Hospital, restraining the criminal
levity of the Red Cross volunteer who would look
or dream of looking at Ostend Cathedral. Mrs.
Torrence, like a seven-year-old child meditating mischief,
like a baby panther at play, like a very young
and very engaging demon let loose, is looking at Dr.
Bird. He is not a Cathedral, but he suffered bombardment
all the same. She got his range with a
roll. She landed her shell in the very centre of his
waistcoat.</p>

<p>Her madness entered into Dr. Bird. He replied
with a spirited fire which fell wide of her and battered
the mess-room door. The orderlies retreated
for shelter into the vestibule beyond. Jean was the
first to penetrate the line of fire. Max followed
him.</p>

<p>Madness entered into Max. He ceased to be a
hospital orderly. He became Prosper Panne again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the very young <i>collégien</i>, as he put down his dishes
and glided unobtrusively into the affair.</p>

<p>And then the young Belgian Lieutenant went mad.
But he gave way by degrees. At first he sat up
straight and stiff with polite astonishment before the
spectacle of a British "rag." He paid the dubious
tribute of a weak giggle to the bombardment of Dr.
Bird. He was convulsed at the first performance of
Prosper Panne. In his final collapse he was rocking
to and fro and crowing with helpless, hysterical
laughter.</p>

<p>For with the entrance of Prosper Panne the mess-room
became a scene at the <i>Folies Bergères</i>. There
was Mrs. Torrence, <i>première comédienne</i>, in the costume
of a wild-western cowboy; there was the young
Lieutenant himself, looking like a stage-lieutenant in
the dark-green uniform of the Belgian Motor Cyclist
Corps; and there was Prosper Panne. He began by
picking up Mrs. Torrence's brown leather motor
glove with its huge gauntlet, and examining it with
the deliciously foolish bewilderment of the accomplished
clown. After one or two failures, brilliantly
improvised, he fixed it firmly on his head. The huge
gauntlet, with its limp five fingers dangling over his
left ear, became a rakish képi with a five-pointed
flap. Max&mdash;I mean Prosper Panne&mdash;wore it
with an "<i>air impayable</i>." Out of his round, soft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
putty-coloured face he made fifteen other faces in
rapid succession, all incomparably absurd. He lit a
cigarette and held it between his lower lip and his
chin. The effect was of a miraculous transformation
of those features, in which his upper lip disappeared
altogether, his lower lip took on its functions,
while his chin ceased to be a chin and became
a lower lip. With this achievement Prosper Panne
had his audience in the hollow of his hands. He
could do what he liked with it. He did. He
caused his motor-glove cap to fall from his head
as if by some mysterious movement of its own.
Then he went round the stalls and gravely and
earnestly removed all our hats. With an air more
and more "<i>impayable</i>" he wore each one of them
in turn&mdash;the grey felt wide-awake of the wild-western
cowboy, the knitted Jaeger head-gear of
the little Arctic explorer, the dark-blue military cap
with the red tassel assumed by Dr. Bird, even the
green cap with the winged symbol of the young
Belgian officer. By this time the young Belgian
officer was so entirely the thrall of Prosper Panne
that he didn't turn a hair.</p>

<p>Flushed with success, Max rose to his top-notch.
Moving slowly towards the open door (centre)
with his back to his audience and his head turned
towards it over his left shoulder, by some extraor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>dinary
dislocation of his hip-joints, he achieved
the immemorial salutation of the <i>Folies Bergères</i>&mdash;the
last faint survival of the Old Athenian Comedy.</p>

<p>Up till now Jean had affected to ignore the performance
of his colleague. But under this supreme
provocation he yielded to the Aristophanic impulse,
and&mdash;<i>exit</i> Max in the approved manner of the
<i>Folies Bergères</i>.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>It is all over. The young Belgian officer has
flown away on his motor cycle to pot Germans;
Mrs. Torrence has gone off to the field with the
Colonel on the quest of the greatest possible danger.
The Ambulance has followed them there.</p>

<p>I am in the mess-room, sitting at the disordered
table and gazing at the ruins of our mess. I hear
again the wild laughter of the mess-mates; it
mingles with the cry of the refugees in the Palais
des Fêtes: "<i>Une petite tranche de pain, s'il vous
plaît, mademoiselle!</i>"</p>

<p><i>C'est triste, n'est-ce pas?</i></p>

<p>In the chair by the window Max lies back with
his loose boyish legs extended limply in front of
him; his round, close-cropped head droops to his
shoulder, his round face (the face of a very young
<i>collégien</i>) is white, the features are blurred and
inert. Max is asleep with his dish-cloth in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in the sudden, pathetic sleep of exhaustion. After
his brief, funny madness, he is asleep. Jean comes
and looks at him and shakes his head. You understand
from Jean that Max goes mad like that now
and then on purpose, so that he may forget in what
manner his mother went mad.</p>

<p>We go quietly so as not to wake him a minute
too soon, lest when he wakes he should remember.</p>

<p>There is a Taube hovering over Ghent.</p>

<p>Up there, in the clear blue sky it looks innocent,
like an enormous greyish blond dragon-fly hovering
over a pond. You stare at it, fascinated, as you
stare at a hawk that hangs in mid-air, steadied by
the vibration of its wings, watching its prey.</p>

<p>You are not in the least disturbed by the watching
Taube. An aeroplane, dropping a few bombs,
is nothing to what goes on down there where the
ambulances are.</p>

<p>The ambulances have come back. I go out into
the yard to look at them. They are not always nice
to look at; the floors and steps would make you
shudder if you were not past shuddering.</p>

<p>I have found something to do. Not much, but
still something. I am to look after the linen for
the ambulances, to take away the blood-stained
pillow-slips and blankets, and deliver them at the
laundry and get clean ones from the linen-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
It's odd, but I'm almost foolishly elated at being
allowed to do this. We are still more or less
weighed down by the sense of our uselessness.
Even the Chaplain, though his services as a stretcher-bearer
have been definitely recognized&mdash;even the
Chaplain continues to suffer in this way. He has
just come to me to tell me with pride that he is
making a good job of the stretchers he has got to
mend.</p>

<p>Then, just as I am beginning to lift up my head,
the blow falls. Not one member of the Field
Ambulance Corps is to be allowed to work at the
Palais des Fêtes, for fear of bringing fever into
the Military Hospital. And here we are, exactly
where we were at the beginning of the week, Mrs.
Lambert, Janet McNeil and I, three women out of
five, with nothing to do and two convalescent orderlies
waiting on us. If I could please myself I
would tuck Max up in bed and wait on <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>In spite of the ambulance linen, this is the worst
day of all for the wretched Secretary and Reporter.
Five days in Ghent and not a thing done; not a
line written of those brilliant articles (from the
Front) which were to bring in money for the Corps.
To have nothing to do but hang about the Hospital
on the off-chance of the Commandant coming back
unexpectedly and wanting a letter written; to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the man with the bullet wound in his mouth a dozen
times a day (he is getting very slowly better; his
poor face was a little more human this morning);
to see the maimed and crippled men trailing and
hobbling about the hall, and the wounded carried
in on their stretchers&mdash;dripping stretchers, agonized
bodies, limbs rolled in bandages, blood oozing
through the bandages, heads bound with bandages,
bandages glued tight to the bone with blood&mdash;to
see all this and be utterly powerless to help; to endure,
day after day, the blank, blond horror of the
empty mess-room; to sit before a marble-topped
table with a bad pen, never enough paper and
hardly any ink, and nothing at all to write about,
while all the time the names of places, places you
have not seen and never will see&mdash;Termonde,
Alost, Quatrecht and Courtrai&mdash;go on sounding
in your brain with a maddening, luring reiteration;
to sit in a hateful inactivity, and a disgusting, an
intolerable safety, and to be haunted by a vision of
two figures, intensely clear on a somewhat vague
background&mdash;Mrs. Torrence following her star of
the greatest possible danger, and Ursula Dearmer
wandering in youth and innocence among the shells;
to be obliged to think of Ursula Dearmer's mother
when you would much rather not think of her; to
be profoundly and irrevocably angry with the guile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>less
Commandant, whom at the moment you regard
(it may be perversely) as the prime agent in this
fatuous sacrifice of women's lives; to want to stop
it and to be unable to stop it, and at the same time
to feel a brute because you want to stop it&mdash;when
<i>they</i> are enjoying the adventure&mdash;I can only say
of the experience that I hope there is no depth of
futility deeper than this to come. You might as
well be taken prisoner by the Germans&mdash;better,
since that would, at least, give you something to
write about afterwards.</p>

<p>What's more, I'm bored.</p>

<p>When I told the Commandant all this he looked
very straight at me and said, "Then you'd better
come with us to Termonde." So straight he looked
that the suggestion struck me less as a <i>bona fide</i>
offer than an ironic reference to my five weeks'
funk.</p>

<p>I don't tell him that that is precisely what I want
to do. That his wretched Reporter nourishes an
insane ambition&mdash;not to become a Special Correspondent;
not to career under massive headlines
in the columns of the <i>Daily Mail</i>; not to steal a
march on other War Correspondents and secure the
one glorious "scoop" of the campaign. Not any
of these sickly and insignificant things. But&mdash;in
defiance of Tom, the chauffeur&mdash;to go out with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Field Ambulance as an <i>ambulancière</i>, and hunt for
wounded men, and in the intervals of hunting to
observe the orbit of a shell and the manner of
shrapnel in descending. To be left behind, every
day, in an empty mess-room, with a bad pen, utterly
deprived of copy or of any substitute for copy,
and to have to construct war articles out of your
inner consciousness, would be purgatory for a journalist.
But to have a mad dream in your soul and
a pair of breeches in your hold-all, and to see no
possibility of "sporting" either, is the very refinement
of hell. And your tortures will be unbearable
if, at the same time, you have to hold your
tongue about them and pretend that you are a genuine
reporter and that all you want is copy and your
utmost aim the business of the "scoop."</p>

<p>After a week of it you will not be likely to look
with crystal clarity on other people's lapses from
precaution.</p>

<p>But it would be absurd to tell him this. Ten to
one he wouldn't believe it. He thinks I am funking
all the time.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>I am still very angry with him. He must know
that I am very angry. I think that somewhere inside
him he is rather angry too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>All the same he has come to me and asked me
to give him my soap. He says Max has taken his.</p>

<p>I give him my soap, but&mdash;</p>

<p>These oppressions and obsessions, the deadly
anxiety, the futile responsibility and the boredom
are too much for me. I am thinking seriously of
going home.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>In the evening we&mdash;the Commandant and Janet
McNeil and I&mdash;went down to the Hôtel de la
Poste, to see the War Correspondents and hear the
War news. Mr. G. L. and Mr. M. and Mr. P.
were there. And there among them, to my astonishment,
I found Mr. Davidson, the American sculptor.</p>

<p>The last time I saw Mr. Davidson it was in Mr.
Joseph Simpson's studio, the one under mine in
Edwardes Square. He was making a bust of
Rabindranath Tagore; and as the great mystic poet
disconcerted him by continually lapsing into meditation
under this process, thereby emptying his beautiful
face of all expression whatever, I had been
called down from my studio to talk to him, so as
to lure him, if possible, from meditation and keep
his features in play. Mr. Davidson made a very
fine bust of Rabindranath Tagore. And here he
is, imperfectly disguised by the shortest of short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
beards, drawing caricatures of G. L.&mdash;G. L. explaining
the plan of campaign to the Belgian General
Staff; G. L. very straight and tall, the Belgian
General Staff looking up to him with innocent,
deferential faces, earnestly anxious to be taught.
I am not more surprised at seeing Mr. Davidson
here than he is at seeing me. In the world that
makes war we have both entirely forgotten the
world where people make busts and pictures and
books. But we accept each other's presence. It is
only a small part of the fantastic dislocation of war.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more different from the Flandria
Palace Hotel, our Military Hospital, than the
Hôtel de la Poste. It is packed with War Correspondents
and Belgian officers. After the surgeons
and the Red Cross nurses and their wounded,
and the mysterious officials hanging about the porch
and the hall, apparently doing nothing, after the
English Ambulance and the melancholy inactivity
of half its Corps, this place seems alive with a rich
and virile life. It is full of live, exultant fighters,
and of men who have their business not with the
wounded and the dying but with live men and live
things, and they have live words to tell about them.
At least so it seems.</p>

<p>You listen with all your ears, and presently Termonde
and Alost and Quatrecht and Courtrai cease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
to be mere names for you and become realities. It
is as if you had been taken from your prison and
had been let loose into the world again.</p>

<p>They are saying that there is no fighting at Saint
Nicolas (the Commandant has been feeling about
again for his visionary base hospital), but that the
French troops are at Courtrai in great force. They
have turned their left [?] wing round to the north-east
and will probably sweep towards Brussels to
cut off the German advance on Antwerp. The
siege of Antwerp will then be raised. And a great
battle will be fought outside Brussels, probably at
Waterloo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waterloo!</span></p>

<p>Mr. L. looks at you as much as to say that is
what he has had up his sleeve all the time. The
word comes from him as casually as if he spoke
of the London and South-Western terminus. But
he is alive to the power of its evocation, to the unsurpassable
thrill. So are you. It starts the current
in that wireless system of vibrations that travel
unperishing, undiminished, from the dead to the
living. There are not many kilometres between
Ghent and Waterloo; you are not only within the
radius of the psychic shock, you are close to the
central batteries, and ninety-nine years are no more
than one pulse of their vibration. Through I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
know how many kilometres and ninety-nine years it
has tracked you down and found you in your one
moment of response.</p>

<p>It has a sudden steadying effect. Your brain
clears. The things that loomed so large, the "Flandria,"
and the English Field Ambulance and its
miseries, and the terrifying recklessness of its Commandant,
are reduced suddenly to invisibility. You
can see nothing but the second Waterloo. You
forget that you have ever been a prisoner in an
Hotel-Hospital. You understand the mystic fascination
of the road under your windows, going
south-east from Ghent to Brussels, somewhere towards
Waterloo. You are reconciled to the incomprehensible
lassitude of events. That is what
we have all been waiting for&mdash;the second Waterloo.
And we have only waited five days.</p>

<p>I am certainly not going back to England.</p>

<p>The French troops are being massed at Courtrai.</p>

<p>Suddenly it strikes me that I have done an injustice
to the Commandant. It is all very well to
say that he brought me out here against my will.
But did he? He said it would interest me to see
the siege of Antwerp, and I said it wouldn't. I
said with the most perfect sincerity that I'd die
rather than go anywhere near the siege of Antwerp,
or of any other place. And now the siege-guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
from Namur are battering the forts of Antwerp,
and down there the armies are gathering towards
the second Waterloo, and the Commandant was
right. I am extremely interested. I would die
rather than go back to England.</p>

<p>Is it possible that he knew me better than I knew
myself?</p>

<p>When I think that it is possible I feel a slight
revulsion of justice towards the Commandant.
After all, he brought me here. We may disagree
about the present state of Alost and Termonde,
considered as health-resorts for English girls, but
it is pretty certain that without him we would none
of us have got here. Where, indeed, should we
have been and how should we have got our motor
ambulances, but for his intrepid handling of Providence
and of the Belgian Red Cross and the Belgian
Legation? There is genius in a man who can go
out without one car, or the least little nut or cog
of a <i>châssis</i> to his name, and impose himself upon
a Government as the Commandant of a Motor Field
Ambulance.</p>

<p>Still, though I am not going back to England as
a protest, I <i>am</i> going to leave the Hospital Hotel
for a little while. That bright idea has come to me
just now while we are waiting for the Commandant
to tear himself from the War Correspondents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
come away. I shall get a room here in the Hôtel
de la Poste for a week, and, while we wait for
Waterloo, I shall write some articles. The War
Correspondents will tell me what is being done,
and what has been overdone and what remains
to do. I shall at least hear things if I can't see
them. And I shall cut the obsession of responsibility.
It'll be worse than ever if there really is
going to be a second Waterloo.</p>

<p>Waterloo with Ursula Dearmer and Janet in the
thick of it, and Mrs. Torrence driving the Colonel's
scouting-car!</p>

<p>There are moments of bitterness and distortion
when I see the Commandant as a curious psychic
monster bringing up his women with him to the
siege-guns because of some uncanny satisfaction
he finds in their presence there. There are moods,
only less perverted, when I see him pursuing his
course because it is his course, through sheer Highland
Celtic obstinacy; lucid flashes when he appears,
blinded by the glamour of his dream, and innocently
regardless of actuality. Is it uncanniness? Is it
obstinacy? Is it dreamy innocence? Or is it some
gorgeous streak of Feminism? Is it the New
Chivalry, that refuses to keep women back, even
from the firing-line? The New Romance, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
gives them their share of divine danger? Or, since
nothing can be more absurd than to suppose that
any person acts at all times and in all circumstances
on one ground, or necessarily on any grounds, is
it a little bit of all these things? I am not sure
that Feminism, or at any rate the New Chivalry,
doesn't presuppose them all.</p>

<p>The New Chivalry sees the point of its reporter's
retirement to the Hôtel de la Poste, since it has
decided that journalism is my work, and journalism
cannot flourish at the "Flandria." So we interview
the nice fat <i>propriétaire</i>, and the <i>propriétaire's</i>
nice fat wife, and between them they find a room
for me, a back room on the fourth floor, the only
one vacant in the hotel; it looks out on the white-tiled
walls and the windows of the enclosing wings.
The space shut in is deep and narrow as a well.
The view from that room is more like a prison than
any view from the "Flandria," but I take it. I
am not deceived by appearances, and I recognize
that the peace of God is there.</p>

<p>It is a relief to think that poor Max will have one
less to work for.</p>

<p>At the "Flandria" we find that the Military
Power has put its foot down. The General&mdash;he
cannot have a spark of the New Chivalry in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
brutal breast&mdash;has ordered Mrs. Torrence off her
chauffeur's job. You see the grizzled Colonel as
the image of protest and desolation, helpless in the
hands of the implacable Power. You are sorry for
Mrs. Torrence (she has seen practically no service
with the ambulance as yet), but she, at any rate,
has had her fling. No power can take from her
the memory of those two days.</p>

<p>Still, something is going to be done to-morrow,
and this time, even the miserable Reporter is to have
a look in. The Commandant has another scheme
for a temporary hospital or a dressing-station or
something, and to-morrow he is going with Car
1 to Courtrai to reconnoitre for a position and incidentally
to see the French troops. A God-sent
opportunity for the Reporter; and Janet McNeil
is going, too. We are to get up at six o'clock in
the morning and start before seven.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Friday, October 2nd.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> get up at six.</p>

<p>We hang about till eight-thirty or nine. A fine
rain begins to fall. An ominous rain. Car 1 and
Car 2 are drawn up at the far end of the Hospital
yard. The rain falls ominously over the yellow-brown,
trodden clay of the yard. There is an om<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>inous
look of preparation about the cars. There is
also an ominous light in the blue eyes of the chauffeur
Tom.</p>

<p>The chauffeur Tom appears as one inspired by
hatred of the whole human race. You would say
that he was also hostile to the entire female sex.
For Woman in her right place he may, he probably
does, feel tenderness and reverence. Woman in a
field ambulance he despises and abhors. I really
think it was the sight of us that accounted for his
depression at Ostend. I have gathered from Mrs.
Torrence that the chauffeur Tom has none of the
New Chivalry about him. He is the mean and
brutal male, the crass obstructionist who grudges
women their laurels in the equal field.</p>

<p>I know the dreadful, blasphemous and abominable
things that Tom is probably thinking about me as
I climb on to his car. He is visibly disgusted with
his orders. That he, a Red Cross Field Ambulance
chauffeur, should be told to drive four&mdash;or is it
all five?&mdash;women to look at the massing of the
French troops at Courtrai! He is not deceived by
the specious pretext of the temporary hospital.
Hospitals be blowed. It's a bloomin' joy-ride, with
about as much Red Cross in it as there is in my
hat. He is glad that it is raining.</p>

<p>Yes, I know what Tom is thinking. And all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the time I have a sneaking sympathy with Tom.
I want to go to Courtrai more than I ever wanted
anything in my life, but I see the expedition plainly
from Tom's point of view. A field ambulance is
a field ambulance and not a motor touring car.</p>

<p>And to-day Tom is justified. We have hardly
got upon his car than we were told to get off it.
We are not going to Courtrai. We are not going
anywhere. From somewhere in those mysterious
regions where it abides, the Military Power has
come down.</p>

<p>Even as I get off the car and return to the Hospital-prison,
in melancholy retreat over the yellow-brown
clay of the yard, through the rain, I acknowledge
the essential righteousness of the point of view.
And, to the everlasting honour of the Old Chivalry,
it should be stated that the chauffeur Tom repressed
all open and visible expression of his joy.</p>

<p>The morning passes, as the other mornings
passed, in unspeakable inactivity. Except that I
make up the accounts and hand them over to Mr.
Grierson. It seems incredible, but I have balanced
them to the last franc.</p>

<p>I pack. Am surprised in packing by Max and
Jean. They both want to know the reason why.
This is the terrible part of the business&mdash;leaving
Max and Jean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>I try to explain. Prosper Panne, who "writes
for the Paris papers," understands me. He can see
that the Hôtel de la Poste may be a better base for
an attack upon the London papers. But Max does
not understand. He perceives that I have a scruple
about occupying my room. And he takes me into
<i>his</i> room to show me how nice it is&mdash;every bit as
good as mine. The implication being that if the
Hospital can afford to lodge one of its orderlies so
well, it can perfectly well afford to lodge me.
(This is one of the prettiest things that Max has
done yet! As long as I live I shall see him standing
in his room and showing me how nice it is.)</p>

<p>Still you can always appeal from Max to Prosper
Panne. He understands these journalistic tempers
and caprices. He knows on how thin a thread an
article can hang. We have a brief discussion on
the comparative difficulties of the <i>roman</i> and the
<i>conte</i>, and he promises me to cherish and protect
the hat I must leave behind me as if it were his
bride.</p>

<p>But Jean&mdash;Jean does not understand at all. He
thinks that I am not satisfied with the service of
our incomparable mess; that I prefer the flesh-pots
of the "Poste" and the manners of its waiters.
He has no other thought but this, and it is abominable;
it is the worst of all. The explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
thickens. I struggle gloriously with the French
language; one moment it has me by the throat and
I am strangled; the next I writhe forth triumphant.
Strange gestures are given to me; I plunge into the
darkest pits of memory for the words that have
escaped me; I find them (or others just as good);
it is really quite easy to say that I am coming back
again in a week.</p>

<p>Interview with Madame F. and M. G., the President.</p>

<p>Interview with the Commandant. Final assault
on the defences of the New Chivalry (the Commandant's
mind is an impregnable fortress).</p>

<p>And, by way of afterthought, I inquire whether,
in the event of a sudden scoot before the Germans,
a reporter quartered at the Hôtel de la Poste will
be cut off from the base of communications and
left to his or her ingenuity in flight?</p>

<p>The Commandant, vague and imperturbable, replies
that in all probability it will be so.</p>

<p>And I (if possible more imperturbable than he)
observe that the War Correspondents will make
quite a nice flying-party.</p>

<p>In a little open carriage&mdash;the taxis have long
ago all gone to the War&mdash;in an absurd little open
carriage, exactly like a Cheltenham "rat," I depart
like a lady of Cheltenham, for the Hôtel de la Poste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
The appearance and the odour of this little carriage
give you an odd sense of security and peace. The
Germans may be advancing on Ghent at this moment,
but for all the taste of war there is in it,
you might be that lady, going from one hotel to
the other, down the Cheltenham Promenade.</p>

<p>The further you go from the Military Hospital
and the Railway Station the more it is so. The
War does not seem yet to have shaken the essential
peace of the <i>bourgeois</i> city. The Hôtel de la Poste
is in the old quarter of the town, where the Cathedrals
are. Instead of the long, black railway lines
and the red-brick façade of the Station and Post
Office; instead of the wooded fields beyond and the
white street that leads to the battle-places south
and east; instead of the great Square with its mustering
troops and swarms of refugees, you have
the quiet Place d'Armes, shut in by trees, and all
round it are the hotels and cafés where the officers
and the War Correspondents come and go.
Through all that coming and going you get the
sense of the old foreign town that was dreaming
yesterday. People are sitting outside the restaurants
all round the Place, drinking coffee and liqueurs
as if nothing had happened, as if Antwerp
were far-off in another country, and as if it were
still yesterday. Mosquitoes come up from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
drowsy canal water and swarm into the hotels and
bite you. I found any number of mosquitoes clinging
drowsily to my bedroom walls.</p>

<p>But there are very few women among those
crowds outside the restaurants. There are not
many women except refugees in the streets, and
fewer still in the shops.</p>

<p>I have blundered across a little café with an affectionately
smiling and reassuringly fat proprietress,
where they give you <i>brioches</i> and China tea,
which, as it were in sheer affection, they call English.
It is not as happy a find as you might think.
It is not, in the circumstances, happy at all. In fact,
if you have never known what melancholy is and
would like to know it, I can recommend two courses.
Go down the Grand Canal in Venice in the grey
spring of the year, in a gondola, all by yourself.
Or get mixed up with a field ambulance which is
not only doing noble work but running thrilling
risks, in neither of which you have a share, or the
ghost of a chance of a share; cut yourself off from
your comrades, if it is only for a week, and go into
a Belgian café in war-time and try to eat <i>brioches</i>and drink English tea all by yourself. This is
the more successful course. You may see hope
beyond the gondola and the Grand Canal. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
you will see no hope beyond the <i>brioche</i> and the
English tea.</p>

<p>I walk about again till it is time to go back to
the Hotel. So far, my emancipation has not been
agreeable.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Evening. Hôtel de la Poste.</i>]</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">dined</span> in the crowded restaurant, avoiding the
War Correspondents, choosing a table where I
hoped I might be unobserved. Somewhere through
a glass screen I caught a sight of Mr. L.'s head.
I was careful to avoid the glass screen and Mr. L.'s
head. He shall not say, if I can possibly help it,
that I am an infernal nuisance. For I know I
haven't any business to be here, and if Belgium had
a Kitchener I shouldn't be here. However you
look at me, I am here on false pretences. In the
eyes of Mr. L. I would have no more right to be
a War Correspondent (if I were one) than I have
to be on a field ambulance. It is with the game
of war as it was with the game of football I used
to play with my big brothers in the garden. The
women may play it if they're fit enough, up to a
certain point, very much as I played football in the
garden. The big brothers let their little sister kick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
off; they let her run away with the ball; they stood
back and let her make goal after goal; but when it
came to the scrimmage they took hold of her and
gently but firmly moved her to one side. If she persisted
she became an infernal nuisance. And if
those big brothers over there only knew what I
was after they would make arrangements for my
immediate removal from the seat of war.</p>

<p>The Commandant has turned up with Ursula
Dearmer. He is drawn to these War Correspondents
who appear to know more than he does. On
the other hand, an ambulance that can get into the
firing-line has an irresistible attraction for a War
Correspondent. It may at any moment constitute
his only means of getting there himself.</p>

<p>One of our cars has been sent out to Antwerp
with dispatches and surgical appliances.</p>

<p>The sight of the Commandant reminds me that
I have got all the funds of the Ambulance upstairs
in my suit-case in that leather purse-belt&mdash;and if
the Ambulance does fly from Ghent without me,
and without that belt, it will find itself in considerable
embarrassment before it has retreated very far.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that I shall have to take my
chance. I have asked the Commandant again
(either this evening or earlier) so that there may
be no possible doubt about it: "If we do have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
scoot from Ghent in a hurry I shall have nothing
but my wits to trust to?"</p>

<p>And he says, "True for you."</p>

<p>And he looks as if he meant it.<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>These remarkable words have a remarkable effect
on the new War Correspondent. It is as if
the coolness and the courage and the strength of
a hundred War Correspondents and of fifty Red
Cross Ambulances had been suddenly discharged
into my soul. This absurd accession of power and
valour<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is accompanied by a sudden immense lucidity.
It is as if my soul had never really belonged
to me until now, as if it had been either drugged
or drunk and had never known what it was to be
sober until now. The sensation is distinctly agreeable.
And on the top of it all there is a peace which
I distinctly recognize as the peace of God.</p>

<p>So, while the Commandant talks to the War
Correspondents as if nothing had happened, I go
upstairs and unlock my suit-case and take from it
the leather purse-belt with the Ambulance funds
in it, and I bring it to the Commandant and lay it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>before him and compel him to put it on. As I
do this I feel considerable compunction, as if I were
launching a three-year-old child in a cockle-shell
on the perilous ocean of finance. I remind him
that fifteen pounds of the money in the belt is his
(he would be as likely as not to forget it). As
for the accounts, they are so clear that a three-year-old
child could understand them. I notice
with a diabolical satisfaction which persists through
the all-pervading peace by no means as incongruously
as you might imagine&mdash;I notice particularly
that the Commandant doesn't like this part of it
a bit. There is not anybody in the Corps who
wants to be responsible for its funds or enjoys
wearing that belt. But it is obvious that if the
Ambulance can bear to be separated from its
Treasurer-Secretary-Reporter, in the flight from
Ghent, it cannot possibly bear to be separated from
its funds.</p>

<p>I am alone with the Commandant while this happens,
standing by one of the writing-tables in the
lounge. Ursula Dearmer (she grows more mature
every day) and the War Correspondents and a few
Generals have melted somewhere into the background.
The long, lithe pigskin belt lies between
us on the table&mdash;between my friend and me&mdash;like
a pale snake. It exerts some malign and poi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>sonous
influence. It makes me say things, things
that I should not have thought it possible to say.
And it is all about the shells at Alost.</p>

<p>He is astonished.</p>

<p>And I do not care.</p>

<p>I am sustained, exalted by that sense of righteousness
you feel when you are insanely pounding
somebody who thinks that in perfect sanity and
integrity he has pounded you.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Saturday, 3rd.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.</span> L. asked me to breakfast. He has told me
more about the Corps in five minutes than the
Corps has been able to tell me in as many days. He
has seen it at Alost and Termonde. You gather
that he has seen other heroic enterprises also and
that he would perjure himself if he swore that
they were indispensable. Every Correspondent is
besieged by the leaders of heroic enterprises, and
I imagine that Mr. L. has been "had" before now
by amateurs of the Red Cross, and his heart must
have sunk when he heard of an English Field Ambulance
in Ghent. And he owns to positive terror
when he saw it, with its girls in breeches, its Commandant
in Norfolk jacket, grey knickerbockers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
heather-mixture stockings and deer-stalker; its
Chaplain in khaki, and its Surgeon a mark for bullets
in his Belgian officer's cap. I suggest that this
absence of uniform only proves our passionate eagerness
to be off and get to work. But it is right.
Our ambulance is the real thing, and Mr. L. is going
to be an angel and help it all he can. He will
write about it in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> and
the <i>Westminster</i>. When he hears that I came out
here to write about the War and make a little
money for the Field Ambulance, and that I haven't
seen anything of the War and that my invasion of
his hotel is simply a last despairing effort to at least
hear something, he is more angelic than ever. He
causes a whole cinema of war-scenes to pass before
my eyes. When I ask if there is anything left
for me to "do," he evokes a long procession of articles&mdash;pure,
virgin copy on which no journalist
has ever laid his hands&mdash;and assures me that it is
mine, that the things that have been done are nothing
to the things that are left to do. I tell him that
I have no business on his pitch, and that I am horribly
afraid of getting in the regular Correspondents'
way and spoiling their game; as I am likely to play
it, there isn't any pitch. Of course, I suppose, there
is the "scoop," but that's another matter. It is
the War Correspondent's crown of cunning and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
valour, and nobody can take from him that crown.
But in the psychology of the thing, every Correspondent
is his own pitch. He has told me very
nearly all the things I want to know, among them
what the Belgian General said to the Commandant
when he saw Ursula Dearmer at Alost:</p>

<p>"What the devil is the lady doing there?"</p>

<p>I gather that Mr. L. shares the General's wonder
and my own anxiety. I am not far wrong in regarding
Alost and Termonde as no fit place for
Ursula Dearmer or any other woman.</p>

<p>Answered the Commandant's letters for him.
Wrote to Ezra Pound. Wrote out the report for
the last three days' ambulance work and sent it to
the British Red Cross; also a letter to Mr. Rogers
about a light scouting-car. The British Red Cross
has written that it cannot spare any more motor
ambulances, but it may possibly send out a small
car. (The Commandant has cabled to Mr. Gould,
of Gould Bros., Exeter, accepting his offer of his
own car and services.)</p>

<p>Went down to the "Flandria" for news of the
Ambulance. The car that was sent out yesterday
evening got through all right to Antwerp and returned
safely. It has brought very bad news. Two
of the outer forts are said to have fallen. The
position is critical, and grave anxiety is felt for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
safety of the English in Antwerp. Mrs. St. Clair
Stobart has asked us for one of our ambulances.
But even if we could spare it we cannot give it up
without an order from the military authority at
Ghent. We hear that Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, one of Mrs. Stobart's
women, is to leave Antwerp and work at our
hospital. She is engaged to be married to Dr. &mdash;&mdash;,
and the poor boy is somewhat concerned for her
safety. I'm very glad I have left the "Flandria,"
for she can have my room.</p>

<p>I wish they would make Miss &mdash;&mdash; come away
too.</p>

<p>Yes: Miss &mdash;&mdash;, that clever novelist, who passes
for a woman of the world because she uses mundane
appearances to hide herself from the world's
importunity&mdash;Miss &mdash;&mdash; is here. The War caught
her. Some people were surprised. I wasn't.<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>Walked through the town again&mdash;old quarter.
Walked and walked and walked, thinking about
Antwerp all the time. Through streets of grey-white
and lavender-tinted houses, with very fragile
balconies. Saw the two Cathedrals<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the Town
Hall&mdash;refugees swarming round it&mdash;and the Rab&mdash;I
can't remember its name: see Baedeker&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
its turrets and its moat. Any amount of time to
see cathedrals in and no Mrs. Torrence to protest.
I wonder how much of all this will be left by
next month, or even by next week? Two of the
Antwerp forts have fallen. They say the occupation
of Ghent will be peaceful; while of Antwerp I
suppose they would say, "<i>C'est triste, n'est-ce pas?</i>"
They say the Germans will just march into Ghent
and march out again, commandeering a few things
here and there. But nobody knows, and by the
stolid faces of these civilians you might imagine that
nobody cares. Certainly none of them think that
the fate of Antwerp can be the fate of Ghent.</p>

<p>And the faces of the soldiers, of the men who
know? They are the faces of important people,
cheerful people, pleasantly preoccupied with the business
in hand. Only here and there a grave face, a
fixed, drawn face, a face twisted with the irritation
of the strain.</p>

<p>Why, the very refugees have the look of a rather
tired tourist-party, wandering about, seeing Ghent,
seeing the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Only they aren't looking at the Cathedral. They
are looking straight ahead, across the <i>Place</i>, up the
street; they do not see or hear the trams swinging
down on them, or the tearing, snorting motors; they
stroll abstractedly into the line of the motors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
stand there; they start and scatter, wild-eyed, with a
sudden recrudescence of the terror that has driven
them here from their villages in the fields.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>It seems incredible that I should be free to walk
about like this. It is as if I had cut the rope that tied
me to a soaring air-balloon and found myself, with
firm feet, safe on the solid earth. Any bit of earth,
even surrounded by Germans, seems safe compared
with the asphyxiation of that ascent. And when the
air-balloon wasn't going up it was as if I had lain
stifling under a soft feather-bed for more than a
year. Now I've waked up suddenly and flung the
feather-bed off with a vigorous kick.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><i>Sunday, 4th.</i>]</p>

<p>(I <span class="smcap">have</span> no clear recollection of Sunday morning,
because in the afternoon we went to Antwerp; and
Antwerp has blotted out everything that went near
before it.)</p>

<p>The Ambulance has been ordered to take two Bel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>gian
professors (or else they are doctors) into Antwerp.
There isn't any question this time of carrying
wounded. It seems incredible, but I am going
too. I shall see the siege of Antwerp and hear the
guns that were brought up from Namur.</p>

<p>Somewhere, on the north-west horizon, a vision,
heavenly, but impalpable, aerial, indistinct, of the
Greatest Possible Danger.</p>

<p>I am glad I am going. But the odd thing is that
there is no excitement about it. It seems an entirely
fit and natural thing that the vision should
materialize, that I should see the shells battering the
forts of Antwerp and hear the big siege-guns from
Namur. For all its incredibility, the adventure lacks
every element of surprise. It is simply what I came
out for. For here in Belgium the really incredible
things are the things that existed and happened
before the War. They existed and happened a hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>dred
years ago and the memory of them is indistinct;
the feeling of them is gone. You have ceased
to have any personal interest in them; if they happened
at all they happened to somebody else. What
is happening now has been happening always. All
your past is soaking in the vivid dye of these days,
and what you are now you have been always. I
have been a War Correspondent all my life&mdash;<i>blasée</i>
with battles. The Commandant orders me into the
front seat beside the chauffeur Tom, so that I may
see things. Even Tom's face cannot shake me in
my conviction that I am merely setting out once more
on my usual, legitimate, daily job.</p>

<p>It is all so natural that you do not wonder in
the least at this really very singular extension of
your personality. You are not aware of your personality
at all. If you could be you would see it
undergoing shrinkage. It is, anyhow, one of the
things that ceased to matter a hundred years ago.
If you could examine its contents at this moment
you would find nothing there but that shining vision
of danger, the siege of Antwerp, indistinct, impalpable,
aerial.</p>

<p>Presently the vision itself shrinks and disappears
on the north-west horizon. The car has shot beyond
the streets into the open road, the great paved
highway to Antwerp, and I am absorbed in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
matters: in Car 1 and in the chauffeur Tom, who is
letting her rip more and more into her top speed
with every mile; in M. C&mdash;&mdash;, the Belgian Red
Cross guide, beside me on my left, and in the Belgian
soldier sitting on the floor at his feet. The
soldier is confiding some fearful secret to M. C&mdash;&mdash;
about somebody called Achille. M. C&mdash;&mdash; bends
very low to catch the name, as if he were trying to
intercept and conceal it, and when he <i>has</i> caught it
he assumes an air of superb mystery and gravity
and importance. With one gesture he buries the
name of Achille in his breast under his uniform.
You know that he would die rather than betray the
secret of Achille. You decide that Achille is the
heroic bearer of dispatches, and that we have secret
orders to pick him up somewhere and convey him in
safety to Antwerp. You do not grasp the meaning
of this pantomime until the third sentry has approached
us, and M. C&mdash;&mdash; has stopped for the third
time to whisper "Ach-ille!" behind the cover of his
hand, and the third sentry is instantly appeased.</p>

<p>(Concerning sentries, you learn that the Belgian
kind is amiable, but that the French sentry is a terrible
fellow, who will think nothing of shooting you
if your car doesn't stop dead the instant he levels his
rifle.)</p>

<p>Except for sentries and straggling troops and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
long trains of refugees, the country is as peaceful
between Ghent and Saint Nicolas as it was last week
between Ostend and Ghent. It is the same adorable
Flemish country, the same flat fields, the same paved
causeway and the same tall, slender avenues of trees.
But if anything could make the desolation of Belgium
more desolate it is this intolerable beauty of
slender trees and infinite flat land, the beauty of a
country formed for the very expression of peace.
In the vivid gold and green of its autumn it has
become a stage dressed with ironic splendour for
the spectacle of a people in flight. Half the population
of Antwerp and the country round it is pouring
into Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> First the automobiles, Belgian officers
in uniform packed tight between women and
children and their bundles, convoying the train.
Then the carriages secured by the <i>bourgeois</i> (they
are very few); then men and boys on bicycles; then
the carts, and with the coming on of the carts the
spectacle grows incredible, fantastic. You see a
thing advancing like a house on wheels. It is a tall
hay-wagon&mdash;the tallest wagon you have ever seen
in your life&mdash;piled with household furniture and
mattresses on the top of the furniture, and on top of
the mattresses, on the roof, as it were, a family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
women and children and young girls. Some of
them seem conscious of the stupendous absurdity of
this appearance; they smile at you or laugh as the
structure goes towering and toppling by.</p>

<p>Next, low on the ground, enormous and grotesque
bundles, endowed with movement and with legs.
Only when you come up to them do you see that
they are borne on the bowed backs of men and
women and children. The children&mdash;when there
are no bundles to be borne these carry a bird in a
cage, or a dog, a dog that sits in their arms like a
baby and is pressed tight to their breasts. Here and
there men and women driving their cattle before
them, driving them gently, without haste, with a
great dignity and patience.</p>

<p>These, for all the panic and ruin in their bearing,
might be pilgrims or suppliants, or the servants
of some religious rite, bringing the votive offerings
and the sacrificial beasts. The infinite land and the
avenues of slender trees persuade you that it is so.</p>

<p>And wherever the ambulance cars go they meet
endless processions of refugees; endless, for the
straight, flat Flemish roads are endless, and as far
as your eye can see the stream of people is unbroken;
endless, because the misery of Belgium is endless;
the mind cannot grasp it or take it in. You cannot
meet it with grief, hardly with conscious pity; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
have no tears for it; it is a sorrow that transcends
everything you have known of sorrow. These people
have been left "only their eyes to weep with."
But they do not weep any more than you do. They
have no tears for themselves or for each other.<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
This is the terrible thing, this and the manner of
their flight. It is not flight, it is the vast, unhasting
and unending movement of a people crushed down
by grief and weariness, pushed on by its own weight,
by the ceaseless impact of its ruin.</p>

<p>This stream is the main stream from Antwerp,
swollen by its tributaries. It doesn't seem to matter
where it comes from, its strength and volume always
seem the same. After the siege of Antwerp
it will thicken and flow from some other direction,
that is all. And all the streams seem to flow into
Ghent and to meet in the Palais des Fêtes.<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>I forget whether it was near Lokeren or Saint
Nicolas that we saw the first sign of fighting, in
houses levelled to the ground to make way for the
artillery fire; levelled, and raked into neat plots
without the semblance of a site.</p>

<p>After the refugees, the troops. Village streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
crowded with military automobiles and trains of
baggage wagons and regiments of infantry. Little
villas with desolate, surprised and innocent faces,
standing back in their gardens; soldiers sitting in
their porches and verandahs, soldiers' faces looking
out of their windows; soldiers are quartered in every
room, and the grass grows high in their gardens.
Soldiers run down the garden paths to look at our
ambulance as it goes by.</p>

<p>There is excitement in the village streets.</p>

<p>At Saint Nicolas we overtake Dr. Wilson and
Mr. Davidson walking into Antwerp. They tell us
the news.</p>

<p>The British troops have come. At last. They
have been through before us on their way to Antwerp.
Dr. Wilson and Mr. Davidson have seen the
British troops. They have talked to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Davidson cannot conceal his glee at getting
in before the War Correspondents. Pure luck has
given into his hands <i>the</i> great journalistic scoop of
the War in Belgium. And he is not a journalist.
He is a sculptor out for the busts of warriors, and
for actuality in those tragic and splendid figures
that are grouped round memorial columns, for the
living attitude and gesture.</p>

<p>We take up Mr. Davidson and Dr. Wilson, and
leave one of our professors (if he is a professor)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
at Saint Nicolas, for the poor man has come without
his passport. He will have to hang about at Saint
Nicolas, doing nothing, until such time as it pleases
Heaven to send us back from Antwerp. He resigns
himself, and we abandon him, a piteous figure
wrapped in a brown shawl.</p>

<p>After Saint Nicolas more troops, a few batteries
of artillery, some infantry, long, long regiments of
Belgian cavalry, coming to the defence of the country
outside Antwerp. Cavalry halting at a fork of
the road by a little fir-wood. A road that is rather
like the road just outside Wareham as you go towards
Poole. More troops. And after the troops
an interminable procession of labourers trudging on
foot. At a distance you take them for refugees,
until you see that they are carrying poles and spades.
Presently the road cuts through the circle of stakes
and barbed wire entanglements set for the German
cavalry. And somewhere on our left (whether
before or after Saint Nicolas I cannot remember),
across a field, the rail embankment ran parallel with
our field, and we saw the long ambulance train, flying
the Red Cross and loaded with wounded, on
its way from Antwerp to Ghent. At this point the
line is exposed conspicuously, and we must have been
well within range of the German fire, for the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
ambulance train&mdash;but we didn't know about the
next ambulance train till afterwards.</p>

<p>After the circle of the stakes and wire entanglements
you begin to think of the bombardment. You
strain your ears for the sound of the siege-guns from
Namur. Somewhere ahead of us on the horizon
there is Antwerp. Towers and tall chimneys in a
very grey distance. Every minute you look for the
flight of the shells across the grey and the fall of a
tower or a chimney. But the grey is utterly peaceful
and the towers and the tall chimneys remain.
And at last you turn in a righteous indignation and
say: "Where is the bombardment?"</p>

<p>The bombardment is at the outer forts.</p>

<p>And where are the forts, then? (You see no
forts.)</p>

<p>The outer forts? Oh, the outer forts are thirty
kilometres away.</p>

<p>No. Not there. To your right.</p>

<p>And you, who thought you would have died rather
than see the siege of Antwerp, are dumb with disgust.
Your heart swells with a holy and incorruptible
resentment of the sheer levity of the Commandant.</p>

<p>A pretty thing&mdash;to bring a War Correspondent
out to see a bombardment when there isn't any bom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>bardment,
or when all there ever was is a hundred&mdash;well
then, <i>thirty</i> kilometres away.<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It was twilight as we came into Antwerp. We
approached it by the west, by the way of the sea, by
the great bridge of boats over the Scheldt. The
sea and the dykes are the defence of Antwerp on
this side. Whole regiments of troops are crossing
the bridge of boats. Our car crawls by inches at
a time. It is jammed tight among some baggage
wagons. It disentangles itself with difficulty from
the baggage wagons, and is wedged tighter still
among the troops. But the troops are moving,
though by inches at a time. We get our front
wheels on to the bridge. Packed in among the
troops, but moving steadily as they move, we cross
the Scheldt. On our right the sharp bows and on
our left the blunt sterns of the boats. Boat after
boat pressed close, gunwale to gunwale, our roadway
goes across their breasts. Their breasts are
taut as the breasts of gymnasts under the tramping
of the regiments. They vibrate like the breasts of
living things as they bear us up.</p>

<p>No heaving of any beautiful and beloved ship,
no crossing of any sea, no sight of any city that
has the sea at her feet, not New York City nor
Venice, no coming into any foreign land, ever thrilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
me as that coming into Antwerp with the Belgian
army over that bridge of boats.</p>

<p>At twilight, from the river, with its lamps lit and
all its waters shining, Antwerp looked beautiful as
Venice and as safe and still. For the dykes are
her defences on this side. But for the trudging
regiments you would not have guessed that on the
land side the outer ramparts were being shelled incessantly.</p>

<p>It was a struggle up the slope from the river bank
to the quay, a struggle in which we engaged with
commissariat and ammunition wagons and troops
and refugees in carts, all trying to get away from
the city over the bridge of boats. The ascent was
so steep and slippery that you felt as though at any
moment the car might hurl itself down backwards
on the top of the processions struggling behind
it.</p>

<p>At last we landed. I have no vivid recollection<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
of our passage through the town. Except that I
know we actually were in Antwerp I could not say
whether I really saw certain winding streets and old
houses with steep gables or whether I dreamed them.
There was one great street of white houses and
gilded signs that stood shimmering somewhere in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the twilight; but I cannot tell you what street it
was. And there were some modern boulevards, and
the whole place was very silent. It had the silence
and half darkness of dreams, and the beauty and
magic and sinister sadness of dreams. And in that
silence and sadness our car, with its backings and
turnings and its snorts, and our own voices as we
asked our way (for we were more or less lost in
Antwerp) seemed to be making an appalling and inappropriate
and impious noise.</p>

<p>Antwerp seems to me to have been all hospitals,
though I only saw two, or perhaps three. One was
in an ordinary house in a street, and I think this
must have been the British Field Hospital; for Mrs.
Winterbottom was there. And of all the women
I met thus casually "at the front" she was, by a
long way, the most attractive. We went into one
or two of the wards; in others, where the cases were
very serious, we were only allowed to stand for a
second in the doorway; there were others again
which we could not see at all.</p>

<p>I think, unless I am rolling two hospitals into
one, that we saw a second&mdash;the English Hospital.
It was for the English Hospital that we heard the
Commandant inquire perpetually as we made our
way through the strange streets and the boulevards
beyond them, following at his own furious pace, los<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>ing
him in byways and finding him by some miracle
again. Talk of dreams! Our progress through
Antwerp was like one of those nightmares which
have no form or substance but are made up of
ghastly twilight and hopeless quest and ever-accelerating
speed. It was not till it was all over that we
knew the reason for his excessive haste.</p>

<p>When we got to Mrs. St. Clair Stobart's Hospital&mdash;in
a garden, planted somewhere away beyond
the boulevards in an open place&mdash;we had
hardly any time to look at it. All the same, I shall
never forget that Hospital as long as I live. It
had been a concert-hall<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and was built principally
of glass and iron; at any rate, if it was not really
the greenhouse that it seemed to be there was a great
deal of glass about it, and it had been shelled by
aeroplane the night before. No great damage had
been done, but the sound and the shock had terrified
the wounded in their beds. This hospital, as everybody
knows, is run entirely by women, with women
doctors, women surgeons, women orderlies. Mrs.
St. Clair Stobart and some of her gallant staff came
out to meet us on a big verandah in front of this
fantastic building, she and her orderlies in the uniform
of the British Red Cross, her surgeons in long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
white linen coats over their skirts. Dr. &mdash;&mdash; whom
we are to take back with us to Ghent, was there.</p>

<p>We asked for Miss &mdash;&mdash;, and she came to us
finally in a small room adjoining what must have
been the restaurant of the concert-hall.</p>

<p>I was shocked at her appearance. She was quieter
than ever and her face was grey and worn with
watching. She looked as if she could not have held
out another night.</p>

<p>She told us about last night's bombardment. The
effect of it on this absurd greenhouse must have
been terrific. Every day they are expecting the bombardment
of the town.</p>

<p>No, none of them are leaving except two. Every
woman will stick to her post<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> till the order comes
to evacuate the hospital, and then not one will quit
till the last wounded man is carried to the transport.</p>

<p>It seems that Miss &mdash;&mdash; is a hospital orderly, and
that her duty is to stand at the gate of the garden
with a lantern as the ambulances come in and to light
them to the door of the hospital, and then to see
that each man has the number of his cot pinned to the
breast of his sleeping-jacket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stobart, very properly, will have none but
trained women in her hospital. But even an untrained
woman is equal to holding a lantern and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
pinning on tickets, so I implored Miss &mdash;&mdash; to let
me take her place while she went back to rest in my
room at Ghent, if it was only for one night. I used
every argument I could think of, and for one second
I thought the best argument had prevailed. But
it was only for a second. Probably not even for a
second. Miss &mdash;&mdash; may drop to pieces at her post,
but it is there that she will drop.</p>

<p>Outside on the verandah the Commandant was
fairly ramping to be off. No&mdash;I can't see the
Hospital. There isn't any time to see the Hospital.
But Miss &mdash;&mdash; could not bear me not to see it, and
together we made a surreptitious bolt for it, and I
did see the Hospital.</p>

<p>It was not like any hospital you had ever seen before.
Except that the wounded were all comfortably
bedded, it was more like the sleeping-hall of
the Palais des Fêtes. The floor of the great concert-hall
was covered with mattresses and beds,
where the wounded lay about in every attitude of
suffering. No doubt everything was in the most
perfect order, and the nurses and doctors knew how
to thread their way through it all, but to the hurried
spectator in the doorway the effect was one of the
most <i>macabre</i> confusion. Only one object stood
out&mdash;the large naked back of a Belgian soldier,
who sat on the edge of his bed waiting to be washed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
He must have been really the most cheerful and
(comparatively) uninjured figure in the whole
crowd, but he seemed the most pitiful, because of
the sheer human insistence of his pathetic back.</p>

<p>Over this back and over all that prostrate agony
the enormous floriated bronze rings that carried the
lights of the concert-hall hung from the ceiling in
frightful, festive decoration.</p>

<p>Miss &mdash;&mdash; whispered: "One of them is dying.
We can't save him."</p>

<p>She seemed to regard this one as a positive slur
on their record. I thought: "Only one&mdash;among
all that crowd!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stobart came after us in some alarm as we
ran down the garden.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with Miss &mdash;&mdash;? You're
not going to carry her off?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "we're not. She won't come."</p>

<p>But we have got off with Dr. &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stobart has refused the Commandant's offer
of one of our best surgeons in exchange. He is a
man. And this hospital is a Feminist Show.</p>

<p>We dined in a great hurry in a big restaurant in
one of the main streets. The restaurant was nearly
empty and funereal black cloths were hung over the
windows to obscure the lights.</p>

<p>Mr. Davidson (this cheerful presence was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
us in our dream-like career through Antwerp)&mdash;Mr.
Davidson and I amused ourselves by planning
how we will behave when we are taken prisoner
by the Germans. He is safe, because he is an American
citizen. The unfortunate thing about me is my
passport, otherwise, by means of a well-simulated
nasal twang I might get through as an American
novelist. I've been mistaken for one often enough
in my own country. But, as I don't mean to be
taken prisoner, and perhaps murdered or have my
hands chopped off, without a struggle, my plan is to
deliver a speech in German, as follows: "<i>Ich bin
eine berühmte Schriftstellerin</i>" (on these occasions
you stick at nothing), "<i>berühmt in England, aber
viel berühmter in den Vereinigten Staaten, und mein
Schicksal will den Presidenten Wilson nicht gleichgültig
sein</i>." I added by way of rhetorical flourish
as the language went to my head: "<i>Er will mein
Tod zu vertheidigen gut wissen</i>;" but I was aware
that this was overdoing it.</p>

<p>Mr. Davidson thought it would be better on the
whole if he were to pass me off as his wife. Perhaps
it would, but it seems a pity that so much good
German should be wasted.</p>

<p>We got up from that dinner with even more haste
than we had sat down. All lights in the town were
put out at eight-thirty, and we didn't want to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
crawling and blundering about in the dark with our
ambulance car. There was a general feeling that
the faster we ran back to Ghent the better.</p>

<p>We left Mr. Davidson and Dr. Wilson in
Antwerp. They were staying over-night for the
fun of the thing.</p>

<p>Another awful struggle on the downward slope
from the quay to the bridge of boats. A bad jam
at the turn. A sudden loosening and letting go of
the traffic, and we were over.</p>

<p>We ran back to Ghent so fast that at Saint Nicolas
(where we stopped to pick up our poor little Belgian
professor) we took the wrong turn at the fork
of the road and dashed with considerable <i>élan</i> over
the Dutch frontier. We only realized it when a
sentry in an unfamiliar uniform raised his rifle and
prepared to fire, not with the cheerful, perfunctory
vigilance of our Belgians, but in a determined, business-like
manner, and the word "Achille," imparted
in a burst of confidence, produced no sympathy
whatever. On the contrary, this absurd sentry
(who had come out of a straw sentry-box that was
like an enormous beehive) went on pointing his rifle
at us with most unnecessary persistence. I was so
interested in seeing what he would do next that I
missed the very pleasing behaviour of the little Belgian
professor, who sat next to me, wrapped in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
brown shawl. He still imagined himself to be on
the road to Ghent, and when he saw that sentry
continuing to prepare to fire in spite of our password,
he concluded that we and the road to Ghent
were in the hands of the Germans. So he instantly
ducked behind me for cover and collapsed on the
floor of the ambulance in his shawl.</p>

<p>Then somebody said "We're in Holland!" and
there were shouts of laughter from everybody in the
car except the little Belgian. Then shouts of laughter
from the Dutch sentries and Customs officers,
who enjoyed this excellent joke as much as we did.</p>

<p>We were now out of our course by I don't know
how many miles and short of petrol. But one of
the Customs officers gave us all we wanted.</p>

<p>It's heart-breaking the way these dear Belgians
take the British. They have waited so long for our
army, believing that it would come, till they could
believe no more. In Ghent, in Antwerp, you
wouldn't know that Belgium had any allies; you
never see the British flag, or the French either, hanging
from the windows. The black, yellow and red
standard flies everywhere alone. Now that we <i>have</i>
come, their belief in us is almost unbearable. They
really think we are going to save Antwerp. Somewhere
between Antwerp and Saint Nicolas the population
of a whole village turned out to meet us with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
cries of "<i>Les Anglais! Les Anglaises!</i>" and
laughed for joy. Terrible for us, who had heard
Belgians say reproachfully: "We thought that the
British would come to our help. But they never
came!" They said it more in sorrow than in anger;
but you couldn't persuade them that the British
fought for Belgium at Mons.</p>

<p>We got into Ghent about midnight.</p>

<p>Dr. &mdash;&mdash; is to stay at the Hôtel de la Poste to-night.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Monday, 5th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mosquitoes from the canal have come up and
bitten me. I was ill all night with something that
felt like malarial fever, if it isn't influenza.
Couldn't get up&mdash;too drowsy.</p>

<p>Mr. L. came in to see me first thing in the morning.
He also came to hear at first hand the story
of our run into Antwerp. He was extremely kind.
He sat and looked at me sorrowfully, as if he had
been the family doctor, and gave me some of his very
own China tea (in Belgium in war-time this is one
of the most devoted things that man can do for his
brother). He was so gentle and so sympathetic
that my heart went out to him, and I forgot all about
poor Mr. Davidson, and gave up to him the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
splendid "scoop" of the British troops at Saint Nicolas.</p>

<p>I couldn't tell him much about the run into Antwerp.
No doubt it was a thrilling performance&mdash;through
all the languor of malaria it thrills me now
when I think of it&mdash;but it wasn't much to offer a
War Correspondent, since it took us nowhere near
the bombardment. It had nothing for the psychologist
or for the amateur of strange sensations, and
nothing for the pure and ardent Spirit of Adventure,
and nothing for that insatiable and implacable Self,
that drives you to the abhorred experiment, determined
to know how you will come out of it. For
there was no more danger in the excursion than in
a run down to Brighton and back; and I know
no more of fear or courage than I did before I
started.</p>

<p>But now that I realize what the insatiable and implacable
Self is after, how it worked in me against
all decency and all pity, how it actually made me feel
as if I wanted to see Antwerp under siege, and how
the spirit of adventure backed it up, I can forgive
the Commandant. I still think that he sinned when
he took Ursula Dearmer to Termonde and to Alost.
But the temptation that assailed him at Alost and
Termonde was not to be measured by anybody who
was not there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>It must have been irresistible.</p>

<p>Besides, it is not certain that he did take Ursula
Dearmer into danger; it is every bit as likely that
she took him; more likely still that they were both
victims of <i>force majeure</i>, fascinated by the lure of
the greatest possible danger. And, oh, how I did
pitch into him!</p>

<p>I am ashamed of the things I said in that access
of insulting and indignant virtue.</p>

<p>Can it be that I was jealous of Ursula Dearmer,
that innocent girl, because she saw a shell burst and
I didn't? I know this is what was the matter with
Mrs. Torrence the other day. She even seemed to
imply that there was some feminine perfidy in Ursula
Dearmer's power of drawing shells to her.
(She, poor dear, can't attract even a bullet within a
mile of her.)<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Lying there, in that mosquito-haunted room, I
dissolved into a blessed state, a beautiful, drowsy
tenderness to everybody, a drowsy, beautiful forgiveness
of the Commandant. I forgot that he intimated,
sternly, that no ambulance would be at my
disposal in the flight from Ghent&mdash;I remember only
that he took me into Antwerp yesterday, and that
he couldn't help it if the outer forts <i>were</i> thirty kilo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>metres
away, and I forgive him, beautifully and
drowsily.</p>

<p>But when he came running up in great haste to see
me, and rushed down into the kitchens of the Hotel
to order soup for me, and into the chemist's shop in
the Place d'Armes to get my medicine, and ran back
again to give it me, before I knew where I was
(such is the debilitating influence of malaria), instead
of forgiving him, I found myself, in abject
contrition, actually asking him to forgive <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>It was all wrong, of course; but the mosquitoes
had bitten me rather badly.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence and Janet McNeil have got to work
at last. All afternoon and all night yesterday they
were busy between the Station and the hospitals removing
the wounded from the Antwerp trains.</p>

<p>And Car 1 had no sooner got into the yard of the
"Flandria" to rest after its trip to Antwerp and
back than it was ordered out again with the Commandant
and Ursula Dearmer and Mrs. Torrence to
meet the last ambulance train. The chauffeur Tom
was nowhere to be seen when the order came. He
was, however, found after much search, in the Park,
in the company of the Cricklewood bus and a whole
regiment of Tommies.</p>

<p>One of these ambulance trains had been shelled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the Germans (they couldn't have been very far from
us in our run from Antwerp&mdash;it was their nearness,
in fact, that accounted for our prodigious haste!),
and many of the men came in worse wounded than
they went out.</p>

<p>We are all tremendously excited over the arrival
of the Tommies and the Cricklewood bus. We can
think of nothing else but the relief of Antwerp.</p>

<p>Ursula Dearmer came to see me. She understands
that I have forgiven her that shell&mdash;and
why. She wore the clothes&mdash;the rather heart-rending
school-girl clothes&mdash;she wore when she
came to see the Committee. But oh, how the youngest
but one has grown up since then!</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence came to see me also, and Janet
McNeil. Mrs. Torrence, though that shell still rankles,
is greatly appeased by the labours of last night.
So is Janet.</p>

<p>They told rather a nice story.</p>

<p>A train full of British troops from Ostend came
into the station yesterday at the same time as the
ambulance train from Antwerp. The two were
drawn up one on each side of the same platform.
When the wounded Belgians saw the British they
struggled to their feet. At every window of the ambulance
train bandaged heads were thrust out and
bandaged hands waved. And the Belgians shouted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>But the British stood dumb, stolid and impassive
before their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence called out, "Give them a cheer,
boys. They're the bravest little soldiers in the
world."</p>

<p>Then the Tommies let themselves go, and the Station
roof nearly flew off with the explosion.</p>

<p>The Corps worked till four in the morning clearing
out those ambulance trains. The wards are
nearly full. And this is only the beginning.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Tuesday, 6th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malaria</span> gone.</p>

<p>The Commandant called to give his report of the
ambulance work. He, Mrs. Torrence, Janet McNeil,
Ursula Dearmer and the men were working all
yesterday afternoon and evening till long past dark
at Termonde. It's the finest thing they've done yet.
The men and the women crawled on their hands and
knees in the trenches [? under the river bank] under
fire. Ursula Dearmer (that girl's luck is simply
staggering!)&mdash;Ursula Dearmer, wandering adventurously
apart, after dark, on the battle-field, found a
young Belgian officer, badly wounded, lying out
under a tree. She couldn't carry him, but she went
for two stretchers and three men; and they put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
young officer on one stretcher, and she trotted off
with his sword, his cap and the rest of his accoutrements
on the other. He owes his life to this manifestation
of her luck.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson has come back from Antwerp.</p>

<p>It looks as if Dr. Haynes and Dr. Bird would go.
At any rate, I think they will give up working on
the Field Ambulance. There aren't enough cars for
four surgeons <i>and</i> four field-women, and they have
seen hardly any service. This is rather hard luck
on them, as they gave up their practice to come out
with us. Naturally, they don't want to waste any
more time.</p>

<p>I managed to get some work done to-day. Wrote
a paragraph about the Ambulance for Mr. L.,
who will publish it in the <i>Westminster</i> under his
name, to raise funds for us. He is more than
ever certain that it (the Ambulance) is the real
thing.</p>

<p>Also wrote an article ("L'Hôpital Militaire, No.
2") for the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>; the first bit of journalism
I've had time or material for.</p>

<p>Shopped. Very <i>triste</i> affair.</p>

<p>Went to mass in the Cathedral. Sat far back
among the refugees.</p>

<p>If you want to know what Religion really is, go
into a Catholic church in a Catholic country under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
invasion. You only feel the tenderness, the naïveté
of Catholicism in peace-time. In war-time you realize
its power.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Evening.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saw</span> Mr. P., who has been at Termonde. He
spoke with great praise of the gallantry of our
Corps.</p>

<p>It's odd&mdash;either I'm getting used to it, or it's the
effect of that run into Antwerp&mdash;but I'm no longer
torn by fear and anxiety for their safety.</p>

<p>[?] Dined with Mr. L. in a restaurant in the
town. It proved to be more expensive than either
of us cared for. Our fried sole left us hungry and
yet conscience-stricken, as if after an orgy, suffering
in a dreadful communion of guilt.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Wednesday, 7th.</i>]</p>

<p>Prepared report for British Red Cross. Wrote
"Journal of Impressions" from September 25th to

<p>Fighting at Zele.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Afternoon.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Got</span> very near the fighting this time.</p>

<p>Mr. L. (Heaven bless him!) took me out with
him in the War Correspondents' car to see what the
Ambulance was doing at Zele, and, incidentally, to
look at the bombardment of some evacuated villages
near it (I have no desire to see the bombardment of
any village that has not been evacuated first). Mr.
M. came too, and they brought a Belgian lady with
them, a charming and beautiful lady, whose name I
forget.</p>

<p>When Mr. L. told me to get up and come with
him to Zele, I did get up with an energy and enthusiasm
that amazed me; I got up like one who has been
summoned at last, after long waiting, to a sure and
certain enterprise. I can trust Mr. L. or any War
Correspondent who means business, as I cannot
(after Antwerp) trust the Commandant. So far,
if the Commandant happens upon a bombardment
it has been either in the way of duty, or by sheer
luck, or both, as at Alost and Termonde, when duty
took him to these places, and any bombardment or
firing was, as it were, thrown in. He did not go out
deliberately to seek it, for its own sake, and find it
infallibly, which is the War Correspondent's way.
So that if Mr. L. says there is going to be a bom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>bardment,
we shall probably get somewhere nearer
to it than thirty kilometres.</p>

<p>We took the main road to Zele. I don't know
whether it was really a continuation of the south-east
road that runs under the Hospital windows;
anyhow, we left it very soon, striking southwards
to the right to find what Mr. L. believed to be a
short cut. Thus we never got to Zele at all. We
came out on a good straight road that would no
doubt have led us there in time, but that we allowed
ourselves to be lured by the smoke of the great factory
at Schoonard burning away to the south.</p>

<p>For a long time I could not believe that it was
smoke we saw and not an enormous cloud blown by
the wind across miles of sky. We seemed to run for
miles with that terrible banner streaming on our
right to the south, apparently in the same place, as
far off as ever. East of it, on the sky-line, was a
whole fleet of little clouds that hung low over the
earth; that rose from it; rose and were never lifted,
but as they were shredded away, scattered and vanished,
were perpetually renewed. This movement
of their death and re-birth had a horrible sinister
pulse in it.</p>

<p>Each cloud of this fleet of clouds was the smoke
from a burning village.</p>

<p>At last, after an endless flanking pursuit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
great cloud that continued steadily on our right, piling
itself on itself and mounting incessantly, we
struck into a side lane that seemed to lead straight
to the factory on fire. But in this direct advance the
cloud eluded us at every turn of the lane. Now it
was rising straight in front of us in the south, now
it was streaming away somewhere to the west of our
track. When we went west it went east. When we
went east it went west. And wherever we went
we met refugees from the burning villages. They
were trudging along slowly, very tired, very miserable,
but with no panic and no violent grief. We
passed through villages and hamlets, untouched
still, but waiting quietly, and a little breathlessly,
on the edge of their doom.</p>

<p>At the end of one lane, where it turned straight
to the east round the square of a field we came upon
a great lake ringed with trees and set in a green
place of the most serene and vivid beauty. It seemed
incredible that the same hour should bring us to this
magic stillness and peace and within sight of the
smoke of war and within sound of the guns.</p>

<p>At the next turn we heard them.</p>

<p>We still thought that we could get to Schoonard,
to the burning factory, and work back to Zele by a
slight round. But at this turn we had lost sight of
Schoonard and the great cloud altogether, and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
ourselves in a little hamlet Heaven knows where.
Only, straight ahead of us, as we looked westwards,
we heard the guns. The sound came from somewhere
over there and from two quarters; German
guns booming away on the south, Belgian [? French]
guns answering from the north.</p>

<p>Judging by these sounds and those we heard afterwards,
we must have been now on the outer edge
of a line of fire stretching west and east and following
the course of the Scheldt. The Germans were
entrenched behind the river.</p>

<p>In the little hamlet we asked our way of a peasant.
As far as we could make out from his mixed French
and Flemish, he told us to turn back and take the
road we had left where it goes south to the village
of Baerlaere. This we did. We gathered that we
could get a road through Baerlaere to Schoonard.
Failing Schoonard, our way to Zele lay through
Baerlaere in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>We set off along a very bad road to Baerlaere.</p>

<p>Coming into Baerlaere, we saw a house with a remarkable
roof, a steep-pitched roof of black and
white tiles arranged in a sort of chequer-board pattern.
I asked Mr. L. if he had ever seen a roof like
that in his life and he replied promptly, "Yes; in
China." And that roof&mdash;if it was coming into
Baerlaere that we saw it&mdash;is all that I can remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of Baerlaere. There was, I suppose, the usual
church with its steeple where the streets forked and
the usual town hall near it, with a flight of steps before
the door and a three-cornered classic pediment;
and the usual double line of flat-fronted, grey-shuttered
houses; I do seem to remember these things as
if they had really been there, but you couldn't see
the bottom half of the houses for the troops that
were crowded in front of them, or the top half for
the shells you tried to see and didn't. They were
sweeping high up over the roofs, making for the entrenchments
and the batteries beyond the village.</p>

<p>We had come bang into the middle of an artillery
duel. It was going on at a range of about a mile
and a half, but all over our heads, so that though we
heard it with great intensity, we saw nothing.</p>

<p>There were intervals of a few seconds between the
firing. The Belgian [? French] batteries were
pounding away on the left quite near (the booming
seemed to come from behind the houses at
our backs), and the German on the right, farther
away.</p>

<p>Now, you may have hated and dreaded the sound
of guns all your life, as you hate and dread any immense
and violent noise, but there is something about
the sound of the first near gun of your first battle
that, so far from being hateful or dreadful, or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
any way abhorrent to you, will make you smile in
spite of yourself with a kind of quiet exultation
mixed very oddly with reminiscence<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> so that,
though your first impression (by no means disagreeable)
is of being "in for it," your next, after the
second and the third gun, is that of having been in
for it many times before. The effect on your nerves
is now like that of being in a very small sailing-boat
in a very big-running sea. You climb wave after
high wave, and are not swallowed up as you expected.
You wait, between guns, for the boom and
the shock of the next, with a passionate anticipation,
as you wait for the next wave. And the sound of
the gun when it comes is like the exhilarating smack
of the wave that you and your boat mean to resist
and do resist when it gets you.</p>

<p>You do not think, as you used to think when you
sat safe in your little box-like house in St. John's
Wood, how terrible it is that shells should be hurtling
through the air and killing men by whole regiments.
You do not think at all. Nobody anywhere near
you is thinking that sort of thing, or thinking very
much at all.</p>

<p>At the sound of the first near gun I found myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
looking across the road at a French soldier. We
were smiling at each other.</p>

<p>When we tried to get to Schoonard from the west
end of the town we were stopped and turned back
by the General in command. Not in the least
abashed by this <i>contretemps</i>, Mr. L., after some parley
with various officers, decided not to go back in
ignominious safety by the way we came, but to push
on from the east end of the village into the open
country through the line of fire that stretched between
us and the road to Zele. On our way, while
we were about it, he said, we might as well stop and
have a look at the Belgian batteries at work&mdash;as if
he had said we might as well stop at Olympia and
have a look at the Motor Show on our way to Richmond.</p>

<p>At this point the unhappy chauffeur, who had not
found himself by any means at home in Baerlaere,
remarked that he had a wife and family dependent
on him.</p>

<p>Mr. L. replied with dignity that he had a wife and
family too, and that we all had somebody or something;
and that War Correspondents cannot afford
to think of their wives and families at these moments.</p>

<p>Mr. M.'s face backed up Mr. L. with an expression
of extreme determination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The little Belgian lady smiled placidly and imperturbably,
with an air of being ready to go anywhere
where these intrepid Englishmen should see fit to
take her.</p>

<p>I felt a little sorry for the chauffeur. He had
been out with the War Correspondents several times
already, and I hadn't.</p>

<p>We left him and his car behind us in the village,
squeezed very tight against a stable wall that stood
between them and the German fire. We four went
on a little way beyond the village and turned into a
bridle path across the open fields. At the bottom
of a field to our left was a small slump of willows;
we had heard the Belgian guns firing from that direction
a few minutes before. We concluded that the
battery was concealed behind the willows. We
strolled on like one half of a picnic party that has
been divided and is looking innocently for the other
half in a likely place.<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But as we came nearer to
the willows we lost our clue. The battery had evidently
made up its mind not to fire as long as we
were in sight. Like the cloud of smoke from the
Schoonard factory, it eluded us successfully. And
indeed it is hardly the way of batteries to choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
positions where interested War Correspondents can
come out and find them.<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>So we went back to the village, where we found
the infantry being drawn up in order and doing
something to its rifles. For one thrilling moment
I imagined that the Germans were about to leap out
of their trenches and rush the village, and that the
Belgians [? French] were preparing for a bayonet
charge.</p>

<p>"In that case," I thought, "we shall be very useful
in picking up the wounded and carrying them
away in that car."</p>

<p>I never thought of the ugly rush and the horrors
after it. It is extraordinary how your mind can put
away from it any thought that would make life insupportable.</p>

<p>But no, they were not fixing bayonets. They
were not doing anything to their rifles; they were
only stacking them.</p>

<p>It was then that you thought of the ugly rush and
were glad that, after all, it wouldn't happen.</p>

<p>You were glad&mdash;and yet in spite of that same
gladness, there was a little sense of disappointment,
unaccountable, unpardonable, and not quite sane.</p>

<p>One of the men showed us a burst shrapnel shell.
We examined it with great interest as the kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
thing that would be most likely to hit us on our way
from Baerlaere to Zele.</p>

<p>We had been barely half an hour hanging about
Baerlaere, but it seemed as if we had wasted a whole
afternoon there. At last we started. We were told
to drive fast, as the fire might open on us at any minute.
We drove very fast. Our road lay through
open country flat to the river, with no sort of cover
anywhere from the German fire, if it chose to come.
About half a mile ahead of us was a small hamlet
that had been shelled. Mr. L. told us to duck when
we heard the guns. I remember thinking that I particularly
didn't want to be wounded in my right arm,
and that as I sat with my right arm resting on the
ledge of the car it was somewhat exposed to the German
batteries, so I wriggled low down in my seat and
tucked my arm well under cover for quite five minutes.
But you couldn't see anything that way, so I
popped up again and presently forgot all about my
valuable arm in the sheer excitement of the rush
through the danger zone. Our car was low on the
ground; still, it was high enough and big enough to
serve as a mark for the German guns and it fairly
gave them the range of the road.</p>

<p>But though the guns had been pounding away before
we started, they ceased firing as we went
through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>That, however, was sheer luck. And presently it
was brought home to me that we were not the only
persons involved in the risk of this joyous adventure.
Just outside the bombarded hamlet ahead of us we
were stopped by some Belgian [? French] soldiers
hidden in the cover of a ditch by the roadside, which
if it was not a trench might very easily have been one.
They were talking in whispers for fear of being overheard
by the Germans, who must have been at least
a mile off, across the fields on the other side of the
river. A mile seemed a pretty safe distance; but
Mr. L. said it wouldn't help us much, considering
that the range of their guns was twenty-four miles.
The soldiers told us we couldn't possibly get through
to Zele. That was true. The road was blocked&mdash;by
the ruins of the hamlet&mdash;not twenty yards from
where we were pulled up. We got out of the car;
and while Mr. L. and the Belgian lady conversed
with the soldiers, Mr. M. and I walked on to investigate
the road.</p>

<p>At the abrupt end of a short row of houses it
stopped where it should have turned suddenly, and
became a rubbish-heap lying in a waste place.</p>

<p>Just at first I thought we must have gone out of
our course somehow and missed the road to Zele.
It was difficult to realize that this rubbish-heap lying
in a waste place ever <i>had</i> been a road. But for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
shell of a house that stood next to it, the last of the
row, and the piles of lath and plaster, and the shattered
glass on the sidewalk and the blown dust everywhere,
it might have passed for the ordinary no-thoroughfare
of an abandoned brick-field.</p>

<p>Mr. M. made me keep close under the wall of a
barn or something on the other side of the street,
the only thing that stood between us and the German
batteries. Beyond the barn were the green fields bare
to the guns that had shelled this end of the village.
At first we hugged our shelter tight, only looking
out now and then round the corner of the barn into
the open country.</p>

<p>A flat field, a low line of willows at the bottom,
and somewhere behind the willows the German batteries.
Grey puffs were still curling about the stems
and clinging to the tops of the willows. They might
have been mist from the river or smoke from the
guns we had heard. I hadn't time to watch them,
for suddenly Mr. M. darted from his cover and made
an alarming sally into the open field.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to find some pieces of nice hot
shell for me.</p>

<p>So I had to run out after Mr. M. and tell him I
didn't want any pieces of hot shell, and pull him
back into safety.</p>

<p>All for nothing. Not a gun fired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>We strolled across what was left of the narrow
street and looked through the window-frames of a
shattered house. It had been a little inn. The roof
and walls of the parlour had been wrecked, so had
most of the furniture. But on a table against the
inner wall a row of clean glasses still stood in their
order as the landlord had left them; and not one of
them was broken.</p>

<p>I suppose it must have been about time for the
guns to begin firing again, for Mr. L. called to us to
come back and to look sharp too. So we ran for it.
And as we leaped into the car Mr. L. reproved Mr.
M. gravely and virtuously for "taking a lady into
danger."</p>

<p>The car rushed back into Baerlaere if anything
faster than it had rushed out, Mr. L. sitting bolt upright
with an air of great majesty and integrity. I
remember thinking that it would never, never do to
duck if the shells came, for if we did Mr. L.'s head
would stand out like a noble monument and he would
be hit as infallibly as any cathedral in Belgium.</p>

<p>It seems that the soldiers were not particularly
pleased at our blundering up against their trench in
our noisy car, which, they said, might draw down
the German fire at any minute on the Belgian lines.</p>

<p>We got into Ghent after dark by the way we
came.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Evening.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Called</span> at the "Flandria." Ursula Dearmer and
two Belgian nurses have been sent to the convent at
Zele to work there to-night.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is here. But you wouldn't know him.
I have just been introduced to him without knowing
him. Before the War he was a Quaker,<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> a teetotaller,
and a pacifist at any price. And I suppose
he wore clothes that conformed more or less to his
principles. Now he is wearing the uniform of a
British naval officer. He is drinking long whiskies-and-sodas
in the restaurant, in the society of Major
R. And the Major's khaki doesn't give a point to
the Quaker's uniform. As for the Quaker, they say
he could give points to any able seaman when it
comes to swear words (but this may be sheer affectionate
exaggeration). His face and his high,
hatchet nose, whatever colour they used to be, are
now the colour of copper&mdash;not an ordinary, Dutch
kettle and coal-scuttle, pacifist, arts-and-crafts copper,
but a fine old, truculent, damn-disarmament,
Krupp-&amp;-Co., bloody, ammunition copper, and bat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>tered
by the wars of all the world. He is the commander
and the owner of an armoured car, one of
the unit of five volunteer armoured cars. I do not
know whether he was happy or unhappy when there
wasn't a war. No man, and certainly no Quaker,
could possibly be happier than this Quaker is now.
He and the Major have been out potting Germans all
the afternoon. (They have accounted for nine.)
A schoolboy who has hit the mark nine times running
with his first toy rifle is not merrier than, if as merry
as, these more than mature men with their armoured
car. They do not say much, but you gather that it is
more fun being a volunteer than a regular; it is to
enjoy delight with liberty, the maximum of risk with
the minimum of responsibility.</p>

<p>And their armoured car&mdash;if it is the one I saw
standing to-day in the Place d'Armes&mdash;it is, as far
as you can make out through its disguises, an ordinary
open touring car, with a wooden hoarding
(mere matchboard) stuck all round it, the whole
painted grey to simulate, armoured painting.
Through four holes, fore and aft and on either side
of her, their machine-guns rake the horizon. The
Major and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; sit inside, hidden behind the
matchboard plating. They scour the country.
When they see any Germans they fire and bring them
down. It is quite simple. When you inquire how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
they can regard that old wooden rabbit-hutch as an
armoured cover, they reply that their car isn't for
defence, it's for attack. The Germans have only to
see their guns and they're off. And really it looks
like it, since the two are actually here before your
eyes, drinking whiskies-and-sodas, and the rest of
the armoured car corps are alive somewhere in
Ghent.</p>

<p>Dear Major R. and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (whom I never met
before), unless they read this Journal, which isn't
likely, they will never know how my heart warmed
towards them, nor how happy I count myself in being
allowed to see them. They showed me how
good it is to be alive; how excellent, above all things,
to be a man and to be young for ever, and to go out
into the most gigantic war in history, sitting in an
armoured car which is as a rabbit-hutch for safety,
and to have been a pacifist, that is to say a sinner,
like Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, so that on the top of it you feel the
whole glamour and glory of conversion. Others
may have known the agony and the fear and sordid
filth and horror and the waste, but they know nothing
but the clean and fiery passion and the contagious
ecstasy of war.</p>

<p>If you were to tell Mr. &mdash;&mdash; about the mystic fascination
of the south-east road, the road that leads
eventually to Waterloo, he would most certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
understand you, but it is very doubtful whether he
would let you venture very far down it. Whereas
the Commandant, sooner or later, will.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Thursday, 8th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had</span> breakfast with Mr. L.</p>

<p>Went down to the "Flandria." They say Zele
has been taken. There has been terrific anxiety
here for Ursula Dearmer and the two Belgian
nurses (Madame F.'s daughter and niece), who
were left there all night in the convent, which may
very well be in the hands of the Germans by now.
An Ambulance car went off very early this morning
to their rescue and has brought them back
safe.</p>

<p>We are told that the Germans are really advancing
on Ghent. We have orders to prepare to leave
it at a minute's notice. This time it looks as if
there might be something in it.</p>

<p>I attend to the Commandant's correspondence.
Wired Mr. Hastings. Wired Miss F. definitely accepting
the Field Ambulance Corps and nurses she
has raised in Glasgow. Her idea is that her Ambulance
should be an independent unit attached to
our corps but bearing her name. (Seems rather a
pity to bring the poor lady out just now when things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
are beginning to be risky and our habitations uncertain.)</p>

<p>The British troops are pouring into Ghent. There
is a whole crowd of them in the <i>Place</i> in front of
the Station. And some British wounded from Antwerp
are in our Hospital.</p>

<p>Heavy fighting at Lokeren, between Ghent and
Saint Nicolas. Car 1 has been sent there with the
Commandant, Ursula Dearmer, Janet McNeil and
the Chaplain (Mr. Foster has been hurt in lifting a
stretcher; he is out of it, poor man). Mrs. Torrence,
Dr. Wilson and Mr. Riley have been sent to
Nazareth. Mrs. Lambert has gone to Lokeren with
her husband in his car.</p>

<p>I was sent for this morning by somebody who
desired to see the English Field Ambulance. Drawn
up before the Hospital I found all that was left of
a Hendon bus, in the charge of two British Red
Cross volunteers in khaki and a British tar. The
three were smiling in full enjoyment of the high
comedy of disaster. They said they were looking
for a job, and they wanted to know if our Ambulance
would take them on. They were keen. They
had every qualification under the sun.</p>

<p>"Only," they said, "there's one thing we bar.
And that's the firing-line. We've been under shell-fire
for fifteen hours&mdash;and look at our bus!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The bus was a thing of heroism and gorgeous
ruin. The nose of its engine looked as if it had
nuzzled its way through a thousand <i>débâcles</i>; its
dark-blue sides were coated with dust and mud to
the colour of an armoured car. The letters
M. E. T. were barely discernible through the grey.
Its windows were shattered to mere jags and spikes
and splinters of glass that adhered marvellously to
their frames.</p>

<p>I don't know how I managed to convey to the
three volunteers that such a bus would be about as
much use to our Field Ambulance as an old greenhouse
that had come through an earthquake. It
was one of the saddest things I ever had to do.</p>

<p>Unperturbed, and still credulous of adventure,
they climbed on to their bus, turned her nose round,
and went, smiling, away.</p>

<p>Who they were, and what corps they belonged to,
and how they acquired that Metropolitan bus I shall
never know, and do not want to know. I would far
rather think of them as the heroes of some fantastic
enterprise, careering in gladness and in mystery
from one besieged city to another.</p>

<p>Saw Madame F., who looks worried. She suggested
that I should come back to the Hospital. She
says it must be inconvenient for the Commandant
not to have his secretary always at hand. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
same time, we are told that the Hospital is filling up
so fast that our rooms will be wanted. And anyhow,
Dr. &mdash;&mdash; has got mine.</p>

<p>I have found an absurd little hotel, the Hôtel
Cecil in the <i>Place</i>, opposite the Hospital, where I
can have a room. Then I can be on duty all day.</p>

<p>Went down to the "Poste." Gave up my room,
packed and took leave of the nice fat <i>propriétaire</i>
and his wife.</p>

<p>Driving through the town, I meet French troops
pouring through the streets. There was very little
cheering.</p>

<p>Settled into the Hôtel Cecil; if it could be called
settling when my things have to stay packed, in
case the Germans come before the evening.</p>

<p>The Hôtel Cecil is a thin slice of a house with
three rooms on each little floor, and a staircase like a
ladder. There is something very sinister about this
smallness and narrowness and steepness. You say
to yourself: Supposing the Germans really do
come into Ghent; there will be some Uhlans among
them; and the Uhlans will certainly come into the
Hôtel Cecil, and they will get very drunk in the
restaurant below; and you might as well be in a trap
as in this den at the top of the slice up all these
abominable little steep stairs. And you are very
glad that your room has a balcony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>But though your room has a balcony it hasn't
got a table, or any space where a table could stand.
There is hardly anything in it but a big double bed
and a tall hat-stand. I have never seen a room
more inappropriate to a secretary and reporter.</p>

<p>The proprietor and his wife are very amiable.
He is a Red Cross man; and they have taken two
refugee women into their house. They have promised
faithfully that by noon there shall be a table.</p>

<p>Noon has come; and there is no table.</p>

<p>The cars have come back from Lokeren and Nazareth,
full of wounded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambert and her husband have come back
from Lokeren. They drove right into the German
lines to fetch two wounded. They were promptly
arrested and as promptly released when their passports
had shown them to be good American citizens.
They brought back their two wounded. Altogether,
ten or fifteen wounded have been brought
back from Lokeren this morning.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Afternoon.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Commandant has taken me out with the Ambulance
for the first time. We were to go to
Lokeren.</p>

<p>On the way we came up with the Lamberts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
their scouting-car. They asked me to get out of
the Ambulance car and come with them. On the
whole, after this morning, it looked as if the scouting-car
promised better incident. So I threw in
my lot with the Lamberts.</p>

<p>It was a little disappointing, for no sooner had
the Ambulance car got clean away than the scouting-car
broke down. Also Mr. Lambert stated that it
was not his intention to take Mrs. Lambert into the
German lines again to-day if he could possibly
help it.</p>

<p>We waited for an exasperating twenty minutes
while the car got righted. From our street, in a
blue transparent sky, so high up that it seemed part
of the transparency, we saw a Taube hanging over
Ghent. People came out of their houses and
watched it with interest and a kind of amiable toleration.</p>

<p>At last we got off; and the scouting-car made
such good running that we came up with our Ambulance
in a small town half-way between Ghent
and Lokeren. We stopped here to confer with the
Belgian Army Medical officers. They told us it was
impossible to go on to Lokeren. Lokeren was now
in the hands of the Germans. The wounded had
been brought into a small village about two miles
away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>When we got into the village we were told to go
back at once, for the Germans were coming in. The
Commandant answered that we had come to fetch
the wounded and were certainly not going back without
them. It seemed that there were only four
wounded, and they had been taken into houses in
the village.</p>

<p>We were given five minutes to get them out and
go.</p>

<p>I suppose we stayed in that village quite three-quarters
of an hour.</p>

<p>It was one straight street of small houses, and
beyond the last house about a quarter of a mile of
flat road, a quiet, grey road between tall, slender
trees, then the turn. And behind the turn the Germans
were expected to come in from Lokeren every
minute.</p>

<p>And we had to find the houses and the wounded
men.</p>

<p>The Commandant went into the first house and
came out again very quickly.</p>

<p>The man in the room inside was dead.</p>

<p>We went on up the village.</p>

<p>Down that quiet road and through the village,
swerving into the rough, sandy track that fringed
the paved street, a battery of Belgian artillery came
clattering in full retreat. The leader turned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
horse violently into a side alley and plunged down
it. I was close behind the battery when it turned;
I could see the faces of the men. They had not
that terrible look that Mr. Davidson told me he saw
on the faces of Belgians in retreat from [?] Zele.
There was no terror in them, only a sort of sullen
annoyance and disgust.</p>

<p>I was walking beside the Commandant, and how
I managed to get mixed up with this battery I don't
know. First of all it held me up when it turned,
then when I got through, it still came on and cut
me off from the Commandant. (The rest of the
Corps were with the Ambulance in the middle of the
village.)</p>

<p>Then, through the plunging train, I caught sight
of the innocent Commandant, all by himself, strolling
serenely towards the open road, where beyond
the bend the Germans were presumably pursuing
the battery. It was terribly alarming to see the
Commandant advancing to meet them, all alone,
without a word of German to protect him.</p>

<p>There were gaps in the retreat, and I dashed
through one of them (as you dash through the traffic
in the Strand when you're in a hurry) and went
after the Commandant with the brilliant idea of defending
him with a volley of bad German hurled
at the enemy's head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>And the Commandant went on, indifferent both to
his danger and to his salvation, and disappeared
down a little lane and into a house where a wounded
man was. I stood at the end of the lane with the
sublime intention of guarding it.</p>

<p>The Commandant came out presently. He looked
as if he were steeped in a large, vague leisure, and
he asked me to go and find Mr. Lambert and his
scouting-car. Mr. Lambert had got to go to Lokeren
to fetch some wounded.</p>

<p>So I ran back down the village and found Mr.
Lambert and his car at the other end of it. He accepted
his destiny with a beautiful transatlantic
calm and dashed off to Lokeren. I do not think
he took his wife with him this time.<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>I went back to see if the Germans had got any
nearer to the Commandant. They hadn't. What
with dressings and bandages and looking for
wounded, the Ambulance must have worked for
about half an hour, and not any Germans had turned
the corner yet.</p>

<p>It was still busy getting its load safely stowed
away. Nothing for the wretched Secretary to do
but to stand there at the far end of the village, looking
up the road to Lokeren. There was a most sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>gular
fascination about the turn of that road beyond
the trees.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at what seemed the last minute of
safety, two Belgian stretcher-bearers, without a
stretcher, rushed up to me. They said there was a
man badly wounded in some house somewhere up
the road. I found a stretcher and went off with
them to look for him.</p>

<p>We went on and on up the road. It couldn't
have been more than a few hundred yards, really, if
as much; but it felt like going on and on; it seemed
impossible to find that house.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>There was something odd about that short stretch
of grey road and the tall trees at the end of it and
the turn. These things appeared in a queer, vivid
stillness, as if they were not there on their own account,
but stood in witness to some superior reality.
Through them you were somehow assured of Reality
with a most singular and overpowering certainty.
You were aware of the possibility of an ensuing
agony and horror as of something unreal and transitory
that would break through the peace of it in a
merely episodical manner. Whatever happened to
come round the turn of the road would simply not
matter.</p>

<p>And with your own quick movements up the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
there came that steadily mounting thrill which is
not excitement, or anything in the least like excitement,
because of its extreme quietness. This thrill
is apt to cheat you by stopping short of the ecstasy
it seems to promise. But this time it didn't stop
short; it became more and more steady and more
and more quiet in the swing of its vibration; it became
ecstasy; it became intense happiness.</p>

<p>It lasted till we reached the little plantation by
the roadside.</p>

<p>While it lasted you had the sense of touching
Reality at its highest point in a secure and effortless
consummation; so far were you from being strung
up to any pitch.</p>

<p>Then came the plantation.</p>

<p>Behind the plantation, on a railway siding, a train
came up from Lokeren with yet another load of
wounded. And in the train there was confusion
and agitation and fear. Belgian Red Cross men
hung out by the doors of the train and clamoured
excitedly for stretchers. There was only one
stretcher, the one we had brought from the village.</p>

<p>Somebody complained bitterly: "<i>C'est mal arrangé.
Avec les Allemands sur nos dos!</i>"</p>

<p>Somebody tried to grab our one stretcher. The
two bearers seemed inclined to give it up. Nobody
knew where our badly wounded man was. Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
seemed very eager now to go and look for him.
We three were surrounded and ordered to give up
our stretcher. No use wasting time in hunting for
one man, with the Germans on our backs.</p>

<p>None of the men we were helping out of the train
were seriously hurt. I had to choose between my
one badly wounded man, whom we hadn't found,
and about a dozen who could stumble somehow into
safety. But my two stretcher-bearers were wavering
badly, and it was all I could do to keep them
firmly to their job.</p>

<p>Then three women came out of a little house half
hidden by the plantation. They spoke low, for
fear the Germans should overhear them.</p>

<p>"He is here," they said; "he is here."</p>

<p>The stretcher-bearers hurried off with their
stretcher. The train unloaded itself somehow.</p>

<p>The man, horribly hurt, with a wound like a red
pit below his shoulder-blades, was brought out and
laid on the stretcher. He lay there, quietly, on his
side, in a posture of utter resignation to anguish.</p>

<p>He was a Flamand, clumsily built; he had a
broad, rather ugly face, narrowing suddenly as the
fringe of his whiskers became a little straggling
beard. But to me he was the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen. And I loved him. I do not think
it is possible to love, to adore any creature more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
than I loved and adored that clumsy, ugly Flamand.</p>

<p>He was my first wounded man.</p>

<p>For I tried, I still try, to persuade myself that if
I hadn't bullied my two bearers and repulsed the attack
on my stretcher, he would have been left behind
in the little house in the plantation.</p>

<p>We got him out of the plantation all right and
on to the paved road. Ursula Dearmer at Termonde
with her Belgian officer, and at Zele with all
her wounded, couldn't have been happier than I was
with my one Flamand.</p>

<p>We got him a few yards down the road all
right.</p>

<p>Then, to my horror, the bearers dumped him down
on the paving-stones. They said he was much too
heavy. They couldn't possibly carry him any more
unless they rested.</p>

<p>I didn't think it was exactly the moment for resting,
and I told them so. The Germans hadn't come
round the turn, and probably never would come;
still, you never know; and the general impression
seemed to be that they were about due.</p>

<p>But the bearers stood stolidly in the middle of the
road and mopped their faces and puffed. The situation
began to feel as absurd and as terrible as a
nightmare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>So I grabbed one end of the stretcher and said I'd
carry it myself. I said I wasn't very strong, and
perhaps I couldn't carry it, but anyhow I'd try.</p>

<p>They picked it up at once then, and went off at
a good swinging trot over the paving-stones that
jolted my poor Flamand most horribly. I told
them to go on the smooth track at the side. They
hailed this suggestion as a most brilliant and original
idea.</p>

<p>As the Flamand was brought into the village, the
Ambulance had got its wounded in, and was ready
to go. But he had to have his wound dressed.</p>

<p>He lay there on his stretcher in the middle of the
village street, my beloved Flamand, stripped to the
waist, with the great red pit of his wound yawning
in his white flesh. I had to look on while the Commandant
stuffed it with antiseptic gauze.</p>

<p>I had always supposed that the dressing of a
wound was a cautious and delicate process. But it
isn't. There is a certain casual audacity about it.
The Commandant's hands worked rapidly as he
rammed cyanide gauze into the red pit. It looked
as if he were stuffing an old crate with straw. And
it was all over in a moment. There seemed something
indecent in the haste with which my Flamand
was disposed of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Commandant observed that my
Flamand's wound looked much worse than it was,
I felt hurt, as if this beloved person had been
slighted; also as if there was some subtle disparagement
to my "find."</p>

<p>I rather hoped that we were going to wait till the
men I had left behind in the plantation had come
up. But the car was fairly full, and Ursula Dearmer
and Janet and Mrs. Lambert were told off to
take it in to Z&mdash;&mdash;, leave the wounded there and
come back for the rest. I was to walk to Z&mdash;&mdash;
and wait there for the returning car.</p>

<p>Nothing would have pleased me better, but the
distance was farther than the Commandant realized,
farther, perhaps, than was desirable in the circumstances,
so I was ordered to get on the car and
come back with it.</p>

<p>(Tom the chauffeur is perfectly right. There are
too many of us.)</p>

<p>We got away long before the Germans turned
the corner, if they ever did turn it. In Z&mdash;&mdash;, which
is half-way between Lokeren and Ghent, we came
upon six or seven fine military ambulances, all huddled
together as if they sought safety in companionship
(why none of them had been sent up to our
village I can't imagine). Ursula Dearmer, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
admirable presence of mind, commandeered one of
these and went back with it to the village, so that we
could take our load of wounded into Ghent. We
did this, and went back at once.</p>

<p>The return journey was a tame affair. Before
we got to Z&mdash;&mdash; we met the Commandant and the
Chaplain and two refugees, in Mr. Lambert's scouting-car,
towed by a motor-wagon. It had broken
down on the way from Lokeren. We took them on
board and turned back to Ghent.</p>

<p>The wounded came on in Ursula Dearmer's military
car.</p>

<p>Twenty-three wounded in all were taken from
Lokeren or near it to-day. Hundreds had to be
left behind in the German lines.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>We have heard that Antwerp is burning; that the
Government is removed to Ostend; that all the English
have left.</p>

<p>There are a great many British wounded, with
nurses and Army doctors, in Ghent. Three or four
British have been brought into the "Flandria."</p>

<p>One of them is a young British officer, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.
He is said to be mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Dr. Haynes and Dr. Bird have not gone. They
and Dr. &mdash;&mdash; have joined the surgical staff of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Hospital, and are working in the operating theatre
all day. They have got enough to do now in all
conscience.</p>

<p>All night there has been a sound of the firing of
machine guns [?]. At first it was like the barking,
of all the dogs in Belgium. I thought it <i>was</i> the
dogs of Belgium, till I discovered a deadly rhythm
and precision in the barking.<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Friday, 9th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hospital is so full that beds have been put
in the entrance hall, along the walls by the big ward
and the secretarial bureau. In the recess by the
ward there are three British soldiers.</p>

<p>There are some men standing about there whose
heads and faces are covered with a thick white mask
of cotton-wool like a diver's helmet. There are
three small holes in each white mask, for mouth and
eyes. The effect is appalling.</p>

<p>These are the men whose faces have been burned
by shell-fire at Antwerp.</p>

<p>The Commandant asked me to come with him
through the wards and find all the British wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
who are well enough to be sent home. I am to take
their names and dress them and get them ready to
go by the morning train.</p>

<p>There are none in the upper wards. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
cannot be moved. He is very ill. They do not
think he will live.</p>

<p>There are three downstairs in the hall. One is
well enough to look after himself (I have forgotten
his name). One, Russell, is wounded in the knee.
The third, Cameron, a big Highlander, is wounded
in the head. He wears a high headdress of bandages
wound round and round many times like an
Indian turban, and secured by more bandages round
his jaw and chin. It is glued tight to one side of
his head with clotted blood. Between the bandages
his sharp, Highland face looks piteous.</p>

<p>I am to dress these two and have them ready by
eleven. Dr. &mdash;&mdash; of the British Field Hospital,
who is to take them over, comes round to enter their
names on his list.</p>

<p>They are to be dressed in civilian clothes supplied
by the Hospital.</p>

<p>It all sounded very simple until you tried to get
the clothes. First you had to see the President,
who referred you to the Matron, who referred you
to the clerk in charge of the clothing department.
An <i>infirmier</i> (one of the mysterious officials who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
hang about the hall wearing peaked caps; the problem
of their existence was now solved for the first
time)&mdash;an <i>infirmier</i> was despatched to find the
clerk. The clothing department must have been
hidden in the remotest recesses of the Hospital, for
it was ages before he came back to ask me all over
again what clothes would be wanted. He was a
little fat man with bright, curly hair, very eager, and
very cheerful and very kind. He scuttled off again
like a rabbit, and I had to call him back to measure
Russell. And when he had measured Russell, with
his gay and amiable alacrity, Russell and I had to
wait until he came back with the clothes.</p>

<p>I had made up my mind very soon that it would
be no use measuring Cameron for any clothes, or
getting him ready for any train. He was moving
his head from side to side and making queer moaning
sounds of agitation and dismay. He had asked
for a cigarette, which somebody had brought him.
It dropped from his fingers. Somebody picked it
up and lit it and stuck it in his mouth; it dropped
again. Then I noticed something odd about his left
arm; he was holding it up with his right hand and
feeling it. It dropped, too, like a dead weight, on
the counterpane. Cameron watched its behaviour
with anguish. He complained that his left arm was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
all numb and too heavy to hold up. Also he said
he was afraid to be moved and taken away.</p>

<p>It struck me that Cameron's head must be
smashed in on the right side and that some pressure
on his brain was causing paralysis. It was quite
clear that he couldn't be moved. So I sent for one
of the Belgian doctors to come and look at him, and
keep him in the Hospital.</p>

<p>The Belgian doctor found that Cameron's head
<i>was</i> smashed in on the right side, and that there
was pressure on his brain, causing paralysis in his
left arm.</p>

<p>He is to be kept in the Hospital and operated on
this morning. They may save him if they can remove
the pressure.</p>

<p>It seemed ages before the merry little <i>infirmier</i>
came back with Russell's clothes. And when he
did come he brought socks that were too tight, and
went back and brought socks that were too large,
and a shirt that was too tight and trousers that were
too long. Then he went back, eager as ever, and
brought drawers that were too tight, and more trousers
that were too short. He brought boots that
were too large and boots that were too tight; and
he had to be sent back again for slippers. Last of
all he brought a shirt which made Russell smile and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
mutter something about being dressed in all the
colours of the rainbow; and a black cutaway morning
coat, and a variety of hats, all too small for
Russell.</p>

<p>Then when you had made a selection, you began
to try to get Russell into all these things that were
too tight or too loose for him. The socks were the
worst. The right-hand one had to be put on very
carefully, by quarter inches at a time; the least tug
on the sock would give Russell an excruciating pain
in his wounded knee; and Russell was all for violence
and haste; he was so afraid of being left behind.</p>

<p>Though he called me "Sister," I felt certain that
Russell must know that I wasn't a trained nurse and
that he was the first wounded man I had ever dressed
in my life. However, I did get him dressed, somehow,
with the help of the little <i>infirmier</i>, and a wonderful
sight he was, in the costume of a Belgian
civilian.</p>

<p>What tried him most were the hats. He refused
a peaked cap which the <i>infirmier</i> pressed on him, and
compromised finally on a sort of checked cricket cap
that just covered the extreme top of his head. We
got him off in time, after all.</p>

<p>Then two <i>infirmiers</i> came with a stretcher and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
carried Cameron upstairs to the operating theatre,
and I went up and waited with him in the corridor
till the surgeons were ready for him. He had
grown drowsy and indifferent by now.</p>

<p>I have missed the Ambulance going out to
Lokeren, and have had to stay behind.</p>

<p>Two ladies called to see Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. One of them
was Miss Ashley-Smith, who had him in her ward
at Antwerp. I took them over the Hospital to find
his room, which is on the second story. His name&mdash;his
names&mdash;in thick Gothic letters, were on a
white card by the door.</p>

<p>He was asleep and the nurse could not let them
see him.</p>

<p>Miss Ashley-Smith and her friend are staying in
the Couvent de Saint Pierre, where the British Field
Hospital has taken some of its wounded.</p>

<p>Towards one o'clock news came of heavy fighting.
The battle is creeping nearer to us; it has
stretched from Zele and Quatrecht to Melle, four
and a half miles from Ghent. They are saying that
the Germans may enter Ghent to-day, in an hour&mdash;half
an hour! It will be very awkward for us and
for our wounded if they do, as both our ambulance
cars are out.</p>

<p>Later news of more fighting at Quatrecht.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Afternoon.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Commandant has come back. They were at
Quatrecht, not Lokeren.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is awake now. The Commandant has
taken me to see him.</p>

<p>He is lying in one of the officers' wards, a small
room, with bare walls and a blond light, looking
south. There are two beds in this room, set side
by side. In the one next the door there is a young
French officer. He is very young: a boy with sleek
black hair and smooth rose-leaf skin, shining and
fresh as if he had never been near the smoke and
dirt of battle. He is sitting up reading a French
magazine. He is wounded in the leg. His crutches
are propped up against the wall.</p>

<p>Stretched on his back in the further bed there is
a very tall young Englishman. The sheet is drawn
very tight over his chest; his face is flushed and he
is breathing rapidly, in short jerks. At first you do
not see that he, too, is not more than a boy, for he
is so big and tall, and a little brown feathery beard
has begun to curl about his jaw and chin.</p>

<p>When I came to him and the Commandant told
him my name, he opened his eyes wide with a look
of startled recognition. He said he knew me; he
had seen me somewhere in England. He was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
certain about it that he persuaded me that I had
seen him somewhere. But we can neither of us remember
where or when. They say he is not perfectly
conscious all the time.</p>

<p>We stayed with him for a few minutes till he
went off to sleep again.</p>

<p>None of the doctors think that he can live. He
was wounded in front with mitrailleuse; eight bullets
in his body. He has been operated on. How
he survived the operation and the journey on the
top of it I can't imagine. And now general peritonitis
has set in. It doesn't look as if he had a
chance.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>We have heard that all the War Correspondents
have been sent out of Ghent.</p>

<p>Numbers of British troops came in to-day.</p>

<p>Went up to see Mr. Foster, who is in his room,
ill. It is hard lines that he should have had this
accident when he has been working so splendidly.
And it wasn't his fault, either. One of the Belgian
bearers slipped with his end of a stretcher when they
were carrying a heavy man, and Mr. Foster got hurt
in trying to right the balance and save his wounded
man. He is very much distressed at having to lie
up and be waited on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>Impossible to write a Journal or any articles while
I am in the Hospital, and there is no table yet in my
room at the Hôtel Cecil.</p>

<p>The first ambulance car, with the chauffeur Bert
and Mr. Riley, has come back from Melle, where
they left Mrs. Torrence and Janet and Dr. Wilson.
They went back again in the afternoon.</p>

<p>They are all out now except poor Mr. Foster
and Mrs. Lambert, who is somewhere with her husband.</p>

<p>I am the only available member of the Corps left
in the Hospital!</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>3.30.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> Germans have appeared yet.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>I was sitting up in the mess-room, making entries
in the Day-Book, when I was sent for. Somebody
or something had arrived, and was waiting below.</p>

<p>On the steps of the Hospital I found two brand-new
British chauffeurs in brand-new suits of khaki.
Behind them, drawn up in the entry, were two brand-new
Daimler motor-ambulance cars.</p>

<p>I thought it was a Field Ambulance that had lost
itself on the way to France. The chauffeurs (they
had beautiful manners, and were very spick and
span, and one pleased me by his remarkable resem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>blance
to the editor of the <i>English Review</i>)&mdash;the
chauffeurs wanted to know whether they had come
to the right place. And of course they hardly had,
if all the British Red Cross ambulance cars were going
into France.</p>

<p>Then they explained.</p>

<p>They were certainly making for Ghent. The
British Red Cross Society had sent them there.
They were only anxious to know whether they had
come to the right Hospital, the Hospital where the
English Field Ambulance was quartered.</p>

<p>Yes: that was right. They had been sent for us.</p>

<p>They had just come up from Ostend, and they
had not been ten minutes in Ghent before orders
came through for an ambulance to be sent at once to
Melle.</p>

<p>The only available member of the Corps was its
Secretary and Reporter. To that utterly untrained
and supremely inappropriate person Heaven sent
this incredible luck.</p>

<p>When I think how easily I might have missed it!
If I'd gone for a stroll in the town. If I'd sat five
minutes longer with Mr. Foster. If the landlord
of the Hôtel Cecil had kept his word and given me
a table, when I should, to a dead certainty, have
been writing this wretched Journal at the ineffable
moment when the chauffeurs arrived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>I am glad to think that I had just enough morality
left to play fair with Mrs. Lambert. I did try to
find her, so that she shouldn't miss it. Somebody
said she was in one of the restaurants on the <i>Place</i>
with her husband. I looked in all the restaurants
and she wasn't in one of them. The finger of
Heaven pointed unmistakably to the Secretary and
Reporter.</p>

<p>There was a delay of ten minutes, no more, while
I got some cake and sandwiches for the hungry
chauffeurs and took them to the bureau to have their
brassards stamped. And in every minute of the ten
I suffered tortures while we waited. I thought
something <i>must</i> happen to prevent my taking that
ambulance car out. I thought my heart would leave
off beating and I should die before we started (I
believe people feel like this sometimes before their
wedding night). I thought the Commandant would
come back and send out Ursula Dearmer instead.
I thought the Military Power would come down
from its secret hiding-place and stop me. But none
of these things happened. At the last moment, I
thought that M. C&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M. C&mdash;&mdash; was the Belgian Red Cross guide who
took us into Antwerp. To M. C&mdash;&mdash; I said simply
and firmly that I was going. The functions of the
Secretary and Reporter had never been very clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
defined, and this was certainly not the moment to
define them. M. C&mdash;&mdash;, in his innocence, accepted
me with confidence and a chivalrous gravity that left
nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>The chauffeur Newlands (the leaner and darker
one) declared himself ready for anything. All he
wanted was to get to work. Poor Ascot, who was
so like my friend the editor, had to be content with
his vigil in the back yard.</p>

<p>At last we got off. I might have trusted Heaven.
The getting off was a foregone conclusion, for we
went along the south-east road, which had not
worked its mysterious fascination for nothing.</p>

<p>At a fork where two roads go into Ghent we saw
one of our old ambulance cars dashing into Ghent
down the other road on our left. It was beyond
hail. Heaven <i>meant</i> us to go on uninterrupted and
unchallenged.</p>

<p>I had not allowed for trouble at the barrier. There
always is a barrier, which may be anything from a
mile to four miles from the field or village where
the wounded are. Yesterday on the way to Lokeren
the barrier was at Z&mdash;&mdash;. To-day it was somewhere
half-way between Ghent and Melle.</p>

<p>None of us had ever quite got to the bottom of
the trouble at the barrier. We know that the Belgian
authorities wisely refused all responsibility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Properly speaking, our ambulances were not supposed
to go nearer than a certain safe distance from
the enemy's firing-line. For two reasons. First,
it stood the chance of being shelled or taken prisoner.
Second, there was a very natural fear that
it might draw down the enemy's fire on the Belgians.
Our huge, lumbering cars, with their brand-new
khaki hoods and flaming red crosses on a white
ground, were an admirable mark for German guns.
But as the Corps in this case went into the firing-line
on foot, I do not think that the risk was to the
Belgians. So, though in theory we stopped outside
the barriers, in practice we invariably got through.</p>

<p>The new car was stopped at the barrier now by
the usual Belgian Army Medical Officer. We were
not to go on to Melle.</p>

<p>I said that we had orders to go on to Melle; and
I meant to go on to Melle. The Medical Officer
said again that we were not to go, and I said again
that we were going.</p>

<p>Then that Belgian Army Medical Officer began
to tell us what I imagine is the usual barrier tale.</p>

<p>There were any amount of ambulances at Melle.</p>

<p>There were no wounded at Melle.</p>

<p>And in any case this ambulance wouldn't be allowed
to go there. And then the usual battle of the
barrier had place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>It was one against three. For M. C&mdash;&mdash; went
over to the enemy, and the chauffeur Newlands,
confronted by two official adversaries in uniform,
became deafer and deafer to my voice in his right
ear.</p>

<p>First, the noble and chivalrous Belgian Red Cross
guide, with an appalling treachery, gave the order
to turn the car round to Ghent. I gave the counter
order. Newlands wavered for one heroic moment;
then he turned the car round.</p>

<p>I jumped out and went up to the Army Medical
Officer and delivered a frontal attack, discharging
execrable French.</p>

<p>"No wounded? You tell us that tale every day,
and there are always wounded. Do you want any
more of them to die? I mean to go on and I shall
go on."</p>

<p>I didn't ask him how he thought he could stop
one whom Heaven had predestined to go on to
Melle.</p>

<p>M. C&mdash;&mdash; had got out now to see the fight.</p>

<p>The Army Medical Officer looked the Secretary
and Reporter up and down, taking in that vision
of inappropriateness and disproportion. There was
a faint, a very faint smile under the ferocity of his
moustache, the first sign of relenting. The Secretary
and Reporter saw the advantage and followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
as you might follow a bend in the enemy's line of
defence.</p>

<p>"I <i>want</i> to go on" (placably, almost pathetically).
"<i>Je veux continuer.</i> Do you by any chance imagine
we're <i>afraid</i>?"</p>

<p>At this, M. C&mdash;&mdash;, the Belgian guide, smiled too,
under a moustache not quite so ferocious as the
Army Medical Officer's. They shrugged their shoulders.
They had done their duty. Anyhow, they
had lost the battle.</p>

<p>The guide and the reporter jumped back into
the car; I didn't hear anybody give the order, but
the chauffeur Newlands turned her round in no
time, and we dashed past the barrier and into
Melle.</p>

<p>The village street, that had been raked by mitrailleuses
from the field beyond it, was quiet when we
came in, and almost deserted. Up a side street,
propped against the wall of a stable, four wounded
Frenchmen waited for the ambulance. A fifth,
shot through the back of his head by a dum-dum
bullet, lay in front of them on a stretcher that
dripped blood.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Grierson in the village, left behind
by the last ambulance. He was immensely astonished
at my arrival with the new car. He had with
him an eager little Englishman, one of the sort that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
tracks an ambulance everywhere on the off-chance
of being useful.</p>

<p>And the Curé of the village was there. He wore
the Red Cross brassard on the sleeve of his cassock
and he carried the Host in a little bag of purple
silk.</p>

<p>They told me that the village had been fired on
by shrapnel a few minutes before we came into it.
They said we were only a hundred [?] yards from
the German trenches. We could see the edge of the
field from the village street. The trenches [?] were
at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>It was Baerlaere all over again. The firing
stopped as soon as I came within range of it, and
didn't begin again until we had got away.</p>

<p>You couldn't take any interest in the firing or
the German trenches, or the eager little Englishman,
or anything. You couldn't see anything but
those five wounded men, or think of anything but
how to get them into the ambulance as painlessly and
in as short a time as possible.</p>

<p>The man on the dripping stretcher was mortally
wounded. He was lifted in first, very slowly and
gently.</p>

<p>The Curé climbed in after him, carrying the Host.</p>

<p>He kneeled there while the blood from the
wounded head oozed through the bandages and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
through the canvas of the stretcher to the floor and
to the skirts of his cassock.</p>

<p>We waited.</p>

<p>There was no ugly haste in the Supreme Act; the
three mortal moments that it lasted (it could not
have lasted more) were charged with immortality,
while the Curé remained kneeling in the pool of
blood.</p>

<p>I shall never become a Catholic. But if I do,
it will be because of the Curé of Melle, who turned
our new motor ambulance into a sanctuary after
the French soldier had baptized it with his blood.
I have never seen, I never shall see, anything more
beautiful, more gracious than the Soul that appeared
in his lean, dark face and in the straight, slender
body under the black <i>soutane</i>. In his simple, inevitable
gestures you saw adoration of God, contempt
for death, and uttermost compassion.</p>

<p>It was all over. I received his missal and his bag
of purple silk as he gathered his cassock about him
and came down.</p>

<p>I asked him if anything could be done. His eyes
smiled as he answered. But his lips quivered as he
took again his missal and his purple bag.</p>

<p>M. C&mdash;&mdash; is now glad that we went on to Melle.</p>

<p>We helped the four other wounded men in. They
sat in a row alongside the stretcher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>I sat on the edge of the ambulance, at the feet
of the dying man, by the handles of the stretcher.</p>

<p>At the last minute the Chaplain jumped on to the
step. So did the little eager Englishman. Hanging
on to the hood and swaying with the rush of the
car, he talked continually. He talked from the moment
we left Melle to the moment when we landed
him at his street in Ghent; explaining over and over
again the qualifications that justified him in attaching
himself to ambulances. He had lived fourteen
years in Ghent. He could speak French and Flemish.</p>

<p>I longed for the eager little Englishman to stop.
I longed for his street to come and swallow him
up. He had lived in Ghent fourteen years. He
could speak Flemish and French. I felt that I
couldn't bear it if he went on a minute longer. I
wanted to think. The dying man lay close behind
me, very straight and stiff; his poor feet stuck out
close under my hand.</p>

<p>But I couldn't think. The little eager Englishman
went on swaying and talking.</p>

<p>He had lived fourteen years in Ghent.</p>

<p>He could speak French and Flemish.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>The dying man was still alive when he was lifted
out of the ambulance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>He died that evening.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>The Commandant is pleased with his new ambulances.
He is not altogether displeased with
me.</p>

<p>We must have been very quick. For it was the
Commandant's car that we passed at the fork of
the road. And either he arrived a few minutes after
we got back or we arrived just as he had got in.
Anyhow, we met in the porch.</p>

<p>He and Ursula Dearmer and I went back to Melle
again at once, in the new car. It was nearly dark
when we got there.</p>

<p>We found Mrs. Torrence and little Janet in the
village. They and Dr. Wilson had been working
all day long picking up wounded off the field outside
it. The German lines are not far off&mdash;at the
bottom of the field. I think only a small number
of their guns could rake the main street of the village
where we were. Their shell went over our
heads and over the roofs of the houses towards the
French batteries on this side of the village. There
must have been a rush from the German lines across
this field, and the French batteries have done their
work well, for Mrs. Torrence said the German dead
are lying thick there among the turnips. She and
Janet and Dr. Wilson had been under fire for eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
hours on end, lifting men and carrying stretchers.
I don't know whether their figures (the two girls
in khaki tunics and breeches) could be seen from
the German lines, but they just trudged on between
the furrows, and over the turnip-tops, serenely regardless
of the enemy, carefully sorting the wounded
from the dead, with the bullets whizzing past their
noses.</p>

<p>Of bullets Mrs. Torrence said, indeed, that eight
hours of them were rather more than she cared for;
and of carrying stretchers over a turnip-field, that
it was as much as she and Janet could do. But they
came back from it without turning a hair. I have
seen women more dishevelled after tramping a turnip-field
in a day's partridge-shooting.</p>

<p>They went off somewhere to find Dr. Wilson;
and we&mdash;Ursula Dearmer, the Commandant and I&mdash;hung
about the village waiting for the wounded
to be brought in. The village was crowded with
French and Belgian troops when we came into it.
Then they gathered together and went on towards
the field, and we followed them up the street. They
called to us to stay under cover, or, if we <i>must</i> walk
up the street, to keep close under the houses, as the
bullets might come flying at us any minute.</p>

<p>No bullets came, however. It was like Baerlaere&mdash;it
was like Lokeren&mdash;it was like every place I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
been in, so far. Nothing came as long as there was
a chance of its getting me.</p>

<p>After that we drove down to the station. While
we were hanging about there, a shell was hurled
over this side of the village from the German batteries.
It careered over the roofs, with a track that
was luminous in the dusk, like a curved sheet of
lightning. I don't know where it fell and burst.</p>

<p>We were told to stand out from under the station
building for fear it should be struck.</p>

<p>When we got back into the village we went into
the inn and waited there in a long, narrow room,
lit by a few small oil-lamps and crammed with soldiers.
They were eating and drinking in vehement
haste. Wherever the light from the lamps fell on
them, you saw faces flushed and scarred under a
blur of smoke and grime. Here and there a bandage
showed up, violently white. On the tables enormous
quantities of bread appeared and disappeared.</p>

<p>These soldiers, with all their vehemence and violence,
were exceedingly lovable. One man brought
me a chair; another brought bread and offered it.
Charming smiles flashed through the grime.</p>

<p>At last, when we had found one man with a
wounded hand, we got into the ambulance and went
back to Ghent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Saturday, 10th.</i>]</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> got something to do again&mdash;at last!</p>

<p>I am to help to look after Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. He has the
pick of the Belgian Red Cross women to nurse him,
and they are angelically kind and very skilful, but
he is not very happy with them. He says: "These
dear people are so good to me, but I can't make out
what they say. I can't tell them what I want."
He is pathetically glad to have any English people
with him. (Even I am a little better than a Belgian
whom he cannot understand.)</p>

<p>I sat with him all morning. The French boy
has gone and he is alone in his room now. It
seems that the kind Chaplain sat up with him all
last night after his hard day at Melle. (I wish
now I had stood by the Chaplain with his Matins.
He has never tried to have them again&mdash;given
us up as an unholy crew, all except Mr. Foster,
whom he clings to.)</p>

<p>The morning went like half an hour, while it was
going; but when it was over I felt as if I had been
nursing for weeks on end. There were so many
little things to be done, and so much that you
mustn't do, and the anxiety was appalling. I don't
suppose there is a worse case in the Hospital. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
is perhaps a shade better to-day, but none of the
medical staff think that he can live.</p>

<p>Madame E&mdash;&mdash; and Dr. Bird have shown me
what to do, and what not to do. I must keep him
all the time in the same position. I must give
him sips of iced broth, and little pieces of ice to
suck every now and then. I must not let him try
to raise himself in bed. I must not try to lift
him myself. If we do lift him we must keep his
body tilted at the same angle. I must not
give him any hot drinks and not too much cold
drink.</p>

<p>And he is six foot high, so tall that his feet
come through the blankets at the bottom of the
bed; and he keeps sinking down in it all the time
and wanting to raise himself up again. And his
fever makes him restless. And he is always thirsty
and he longs for hot tea more than iced water, and
for more iced water than is good for him. The
iced broth that is his only nourishment he does not
want at all.</p>

<p>And then he must be kept very quiet. I must
not let him talk more than is necessary to tell me
what he wants, or he will die of exhaustion. And
what he wants is to talk every minute that he is
awake.</p>

<p>He drops off to sleep, breathing in jerks and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
a terrible rapidity. And I think it will be all right
as long as he sleeps. But his sleep only lasts for
a few minutes. I hear the rhythm of his breathing
alter; it slackens and goes slow; then it jerks again,
and I know that he is awake.</p>

<p>And then he begins. He says things that tear
at your heart. He has looks and gestures that
break it&mdash;the adorable, wilful smile of a child that
knows that it is being watched when you find his
hand groping too often for the glass of iced water
that stands beside his bed; a still more adorable and
utterly gentle submission when you take the glass
from him; when you tell him not to say anything
more just yet but to go to sleep again. You feel
as if you were guilty of act after act of nameless
and abominable cruelty.</p>

<p>He sticks to it that he has seen me before, that
he has heard of me, that his people know me. And
he wants to know what I do and where I live and
where it was that he saw me. Once, when I
thought he had gone to sleep, I heard him begin
again: "Where did you say you lived?"</p>

<p>I tell him. And I tell him to go to sleep again.</p>

<p>He closes his eyes obediently and opens them the
next instant.</p>

<p>"I say, may I come and call on you when we
get back to England?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>You can only say: "Yes. Of course," and tell
him to go to sleep.</p>

<p>His voice is so strong and clear that I could almost
believe that he will get back and that some
day I shall look up and see him standing at my
garden gate.</p>

<p>Mercifully, when I tell him to go to sleep again,
he does go to sleep. And his voice is a little clearer
and stronger every time he wakes.</p>

<p>And so the morning goes on. The only thing he
wants you to do for him is to sponge his hands and
face with iced water and to give him little bits of
ice to suck. Over and over again I do these things.
And over and over again he asks me, "Do you
mind?"</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>He wears a little grey woollen cord round his
neck. Something has gone from it. Whatever he
has lost, they have left him his little woollen cord,
as if some immense importance attached to it.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>He has fallen into a long doze. And at the end
of the morning I left him sleeping.</p>

<p>Some of the Corps have brought in trophies from
the battle-field&mdash;a fine grey cloak with a scarlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
collar, a spiked helmet, a cuff with three buttons
cut from the coat of a dead German.</p>

<p>These things make me sick. I see the body under
the cloak, the head under the helmet, and the dead
hand under the cuff.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Afternoon.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saw</span> Mr. Foster. He is to be sent back to England
for an operation. Dr. Wilson is to take him.
He asked me if I thought the Commandant would
take him back again when he is better.</p>

<p>Saw the President about Mr. Foster. He will
not hear of his going back to England. He wants
him to stay in the Hospital and be operated on here.
He promises the utmost care and attention. He is
most distressed to think that he should go.</p>

<p>It doesn't occur to him in his kindness that it
would be much more distressing if the Germans
came into Ghent and interrupted the operation.</p>

<p>Cabled Miss F. about her Glasgow ambulance,
asking her to pay her staff if her funds ran to it.
Cabled British Red Cross to send Mr. Gould and
his scouting-car here instead of to France. Cabled
Mr. Gould to get the British Red Cross to send
him here.</p>

<p>Mr. Lambert has been ill with malaria. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
gone back to England to get well again and to repair
the car that broke down at Lokeren.<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Somebody else is to look after Mr. &mdash;&mdash; this afternoon.</p>

<p>I have been given leave rather reluctantly to sit
up with him at night.</p>

<p>The Commandant is going to take me in Tom's
Daimler (Car 1) to the British lines to look for a
base for that temporary hospital which is still running
in his head like a splendid dream. I do not
see how, with the Germans at Melle, only four and
a half miles off, any sort of hospital is to be established
on this side of Ghent.</p>

<p>Tom, the chauffeur, does not look with favour
on the expedition. I have had to point out to him
that a Field Ambulance is <i>not</i>, as he would say,
the House of Commons, and that there is a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
propriety binding even on a chauffeur and a limit
to the freedom of the speech you may apply to your
Commandant. This afternoon Tom has exceeded
all the limits. The worst of Tom is that while his
tongue rages on the confines of revolt, he himself
is punctilious to excess on the point of orders.
Either he has orders or he hasn't them. If he has
them he obeys them with a punctuality that puts
everybody else in the wrong. If he hasn't them,
an earthquake wouldn't make him move. Such is
his devotion to orders that he will insist on any
one order holding good for an unlimited time after
it has been given.</p>

<p>So now, in defence of his manners, he urges
that what with orders and counter-orders, the provocation
is more than flesh and blood can stand. Tom
himself is protest clothed in flesh and blood.</p>

<p>To-day at two o'clock Tom's orders are that his
car is to be ready at two-thirty. My orders are to
be ready in twenty minutes. I <i>am</i> ready in twenty
minutes. The Commandant thinks that he has
transacted all his business and is ready in twenty
minutes too. Tom and his car are nowhere to be
seen. I go to look for Tom. Tom is reported as
being last seen riding on a motor-lorry towards the
British lines in the company of a detachment of
British infantry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The chauffeur Tom is considered to have disgraced
himself everlastingly.</p>

<p>Punctually at two-thirty he appears with his car
at the door of the "Flandria."</p>

<p>The Commandant is nowhere to be seen. He
has gone to look for Tom.</p>

<p>I reprove Tom for the sin of unpunctuality, and
he has me.</p>

<p>His orders were to be ready at two-thirty and
he is ready at two-thirty. And it is nobody's business
what he did with himself ten minutes before.
He wants to know where the Commandant is.</p>

<p>I go to look for the Commandant.</p>

<p>The Commandant is reported to have been last
seen going through the Hospital on his way to the
garage. I go round to the garage through the Hospital;
and the Commandant goes out of the garage
by the street. He was last seen <i>in</i> the garage.</p>

<p>He appears suddenly from some quarter where
you wouldn't expect him in the least. He reproves
Tom.</p>

<p>Tom with considerable violence declares his
righteousness. He has gathered to himself a friend,
a Belgian Red Cross man, whose language he does
not understand. But they exchange winks that surpass
all language.</p>

<p>Then the Commandant remembers that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
several cables to send off. He is seen disappearing
in the direction of the Post and Telegraph
Office.</p>

<p>Tom swallows words that would be curses if I
were not there.</p>

<p>I keep my eyes fixed on the doors of the Post
Office. Ages pass.</p>

<p>I go to the Post Office to look for the Commandant.
He is not in the Telegraph Office. He is not
in the Post Office. Tom keeps his eyes on the doors
of both.</p>

<p>More ages pass. Finally, the Commandant appears
from inside the Hospital, which he has not
been seen to enter.</p>

<p>The chauffeur Tom dismounts and draws from
his car's mysterious being sounds that express the
savage fury of his resentment.</p>

<p>You would think we were off now. But we only
get as far as a street somewhere near the Hôtel de
la Poste. Here we wait for apparently no reason
in such tension that you can hear the ages pass.</p>

<p>The Commandant disappears.</p>

<p>Tom says something about there being no room
for the wounded at this rate.</p>

<p>It seems his orders are to go first to the British
lines at a place whose name I forget, and then on
to Melle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember Tom's views on the subject of field-women.
And suddenly I seem to understand them.
Tom is very like Lord Kitchener. He knows nothing
about the aims and wants of modern womanhood
and he cares less. The modern woman does
not ask to be protected, does not want to be protected,
and Tom, like Lord Kitchener, will go on
protecting. You cannot elevate men like Lord
Kitchener and Tom above the primitive plane of
chivalry. Tom in the danger zone with a woman
by his side feels about as peaceful and comfortable
as a woman in the danger zone with a two-year-old
baby in her lap. A bomb in his bedroom is one
thing and a band of drunken Uhlans making for his
women is another. Tom's nerves are racked with
problems: How the dickens is he to steer his car
and protect his women at the same time? And if
it comes to a toss-up between his women and his
wounded? You've got to stow the silly things
somewhere, and every one of them takes up the
place of a wounded man.</p>

<p>I get out of the car and tell the Commandant
that I would rather not go than take up the place
of a wounded man.</p>

<p>He orders me back to the car again. Tom seems
inclined to regard me as a woman who has done her
best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>We go on a little way and stop again. And there
springs out of the pavement a curious figure that
I have seen somewhere before in Ghent, I cannot
remember when or where. The figure wears a
check suit of extreme horsyness and carries a kodak
in its hand. It is excited.</p>

<p>There is something about it that reminds me now
of the eager little Englishman at Melle. These
figures spring up everywhere in the track of a field
ambulance.</p>

<p>When Tom sees it he groans in despair.</p>

<p>The Commandant gets out and appears to be
offering it the hospitality of the car. I am introduced.</p>

<p>To my horror the figure skips round in front of
the car, levels its kodak at my head and implores me
to sit still.</p>

<p>I am very rude. I tell it sternly to take that
beastly thing away and go away itself.</p>

<p>It goes, rather startled.</p>

<p>And we get off, somehow, without it, and arrive
at the end of the street.</p>

<p>Here Tom has orders to stop at the first hat-shop
he comes to.</p>

<p>The Commandant has lost his hat at Melle (he
has been wearing little Janet's Arctic cap, to the delight
of everybody). He has just remembered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
he wants a hat and he thinks that he will get it
now.</p>

<p>At this point I break down. I hear myself say
"Damn" five times, softly but distinctly. (This
after reproving Tom for unfettered speech and potential
insubordination.)</p>

<p>Tom stops at a hat-shop. The Commandant to
his doom enters, and presently returns wearing a
soft felt hat of a vivid green. He asks me what
I think of it.</p>

<p>I tell him all I think of it, and he says that if I
feel like that about it he'll go in again and get another
one.</p>

<p>I forget what I said then except that I wanted to
get on to Melle. That Melle was the place of all
places where I most wished to be.</p>

<p>Then, lest he might feel unhappy in his green
hat, I said that if he would leave it out all night in
the rain and then sit on it no doubt time and
weather and God would do something for it.</p>

<p>This time we were off, and when I realized it I
said "Hurray!"<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Tom had not said anything for some considerable
time.</p>

<p>We found the British lines in a little village just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
outside of Ghent. No place there for a base hospital.</p>

<p>We hung about here for twenty minutes, and the
women and children came out to stare at us with
innocent, pathetic faces.</p>

<p>Somebody had stowed away one of the trophies&mdash;the
spiked German helmet&mdash;in the ambulance
car, and the chauffeur Tom stuck it on a stick and
held it up before the British lines. It was greeted
with cheers and a great shout of laughter from the
troops; and the villagers came running out of their
houses to look; they uttered little sharp and guttural
cries of satisfaction. The whole thing was a bit
savage and barbaric and horribly impressive.</p>

<p>Finally we left the British lines and set out towards
Melle by a cross-road.</p>

<p>We got through all right. A thousand accidents
may delay his going, but once off, no barriers exist
for the Commandant. Seated in the front of the
car, utterly unperturbed by the chauffeur Tom's
sarcastic comments on men, things and women,
wrapped (apparently) in a beautiful dream, he
looks straight ahead with eyes whose vagueness
veils a deadly simplicity of purpose. I marvel at
the transfiguration of the Commandant. Before
the War he was a fairly complex personality. Now
he has ceased to exist as a separate individual. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
is merged, vaguely and vastly, in his adventure.
He is the Motor Ambulance Field Corps; he is the
ambulance car; he is the electric spark and the continuous
explosion that drives the thing along. It is
useless to talk to him about anything that happened
before the War or about anything that exists outside
it. He would not admit that anything did exist
outside it. He is capable of forgetting the day
of the week and the precise number of female units
in his company and the amount standing to his credit
at his banker's, but, once off, he is cock-sure of the
shortest cut to the firing-line within a radius of
fifty kilometres.</p>

<p>Some of us who have never seen a human phenomenon
of this sort are ready to deny him an
identity. They complain of his inveterate and deplorable
lack of any sense of detail. This is absurd.
You might as well insist on a faithful representation
of the household furniture of the burgomaster
of Zoetenaeg, which is the smallest village in
Belgium, in drawing the map of Europe to scale.
At the critical moment this more than continental
vastness gathers to a wedge-like determination that
goes home. He means to get through.</p>

<p>We ran into Melle about an hour before sunset.</p>

<p>There had been a great slaughter of Germans on
the field outside the village where the Germans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
still firing when the Corps left it. We found two
of our cars drawn up by the side of the village street,
close under the houses. The Chaplain, Ursula
Dearmer and Mrs. Lambert were waiting in one of
them, the new Daimler, with the chauffeur Newlands.
Dr. Wilson was in Bert's car with three
wounded Germans. He was sitting in front with
one of them beside him. They say that the enemy's
wounded sometimes fire on our surgeons and Red
Cross men, and Dr. Wilson had a revolver about
him when he went on the battle-field yesterday.
He said he wasn't taking any risks. The man he
had got beside him to-day was only wounded in the
foot, and had his hands entirely free to do what he
liked with. He looked rather a low type, and at
the first sight of him I thought I shouldn't have
cared to be alone with him anywhere on a dark
night.</p>

<p>And then I saw the look on his face. He was
purely pathetic. He didn't look at you. He
stared in front of him down the road towards
Ghent, in a dull, helpless misery. These unhappy
German Tommies are afraid of us. They are told
that we shall treat them badly, and some of them
believe it. I wanted Dr. Wilson to let me get up
and go with the poor fellow, but he wouldn't. He
was sorry for him and very gentle. He is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
sorry for people and very gentle. So I knew that
the German would be all right with him. But I
should have liked to have gone.</p>

<p>We found Mrs. Torrence and Janet with M. &mdash;&mdash;
on the other side of the street, left behind by Dr.
Wilson. They have been working all day yesterday
and half the night and all this morning and
afternoon on that hideous turnip-field. They have
seen things and combinations of things that no forewarning
imagination could have devised. Last
night the car was fired on where it stood waiting for
them in the village, and they had to race back to it
under a shower of bullets.</p>

<p>They were as fresh as paint and very cheerful.
Mrs. Torrence was wearing a large silver order on
a broad blue ribbon pinned to her khaki overcoat.
It was given to her to-day as the reward of valour
by the Belgian General in command here. Somebody
took it from the breast of a Prussian officer.
She had covered it up with her khaki scarf so that
she might not seem to swank.</p>

<p>Little Janet was with her. She always is with
her. She looked younger than ever, more impassive
than ever, more adorable than ever. I have
got used to Mrs. Torrence and to Ursula Dearmer;
but I cannot get used to Janet. It always seems
appalling to me that she should be here, strolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
about the seat of War with her hands in her pockets,
as if a battle were a cricket-match at which you
looked on between your innings. And yet there
isn't a man in the Corps who does his work better,
and with more courage and endurance, than this
eighteen-year-old child.</p>

<p>They told us that there were no French or Belgian
wounded left, but that two wounded Germans
were still lying over there among the turnips. They
were waiting for our car to come out and take these
men up. The car was now drawn up close under
some building that looked like a town hall, on the
other side of the street. We were in the middle
of the village. The village itself was the extreme
fringe of the danger zone. Where the houses
ended, a stretch of white road ran up for about [?]
a hundred yards to the turnip-field. Standing in
the village street, we could see the turnip-field, but
not all of it. The road goes straight up to the edge
of it and turns there with a sweep to the left and
runs alongside for about a mile and a half.</p>

<p>On the other side of the turnip-field were the
German lines. The first that had raked the village
street also raked the fields and the mile and a half of
road alongside.</p>

<p>It was along that road that the car would have
to go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>M. &mdash;&mdash; told our Ambulance that it might as well
go back. There were no more wounded. Only
two Germans lying in a turnip-field. The three of
us&mdash;Mrs. Torrence and Janet and I&mdash;tried to
bring pressure to bear on M. &mdash;&mdash;. We meant to
go and get those Germans.</p>

<p>But M. &mdash;&mdash; was impervious to pressure. He
refused either to go with the car himself or to let
us go. He said we were too late and it was too
far and there wouldn't be light enough. He said
that for two Belgians, or two French, or two
British, it would be worth while taking risks. But
for two Germans under German fire it wasn't good
enough.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Torrence and Janet and I didn't agree
with him. Wounded were wounded. We said we
were going if he wasn't.</p>

<p>Then the chauffeur Tom joined in. He refused
to offer his car as a target for the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Our
firm Belgian was equally determined. The Commandant,
as if roused from his beautiful dream to
a sudden realization of the horrors of war, absolutely
forbade the expedition.</p>

<p>It took place all the same.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom's car, planted there on our side of the street,
hugging the wall, with its hood over its eyes, preserved
its attitude of obstinate immobility. Newlands'
car, hugging the wall on the other side of
the street, stood discreetly apart from the discussion.
But a Belgian military ambulance car ran
up, smaller and more alert than ours. And a Belgian
Army Medical Officer strolled up to see what
was happening.</p>

<p>We three advanced on that Army Medical Officer,
Mrs. Torrence and Janet on his left and I on his
right.</p>

<p>I shall always be grateful to that righteous man.
He gave Mrs. Torrence and Janet leave to go, and
he gave me leave to go with them; he gave us the
military ambulance to go in and a Belgian soldier
with a rifle to protect us. And he didn't waste a
second over it. He just looked at us, and smiled,
and let us go.</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence got on to the ambulance beside
the driver, Janet jumped on to one step and I on to
the other, while the Commandant came up, trying to
look stern, and told me to get down.</p>

<p>I hung on all the tighter.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What happened then was so ignominious, so sickening,
that, if I were not sworn to the utmost pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>sible
realism in this record, I should suppress it in
the interests of human dignity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence, having the advantage of me in
weight, height, muscle and position, got up and tried
to push me off the step. As she did this she said:
"You can't come. You'll take up the place of a
wounded man."</p>

<p>And I found myself standing in the village street,
while the car rushed out of it, with Janet clinging
on to the hood, like a little sailor to his shrouds.
She was on the side next the German guns.</p>

<p>It was the most revolting thing that had happened
to me yet, in a life filled with incidents that I have
no desire to repeat. And it made me turn on the
Commandant in a way that I do not like to think of.
I believe I asked him how he could bear to let that
kid go into the German lines, which was exactly
what the poor man hadn't done.<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Then we waited, Mrs. Lambert and I in Tom's
car; and the Commandant in the car with Ursula
Dearmer and the Chaplain on the other side of the
street.</p>

<p>We were dreadfully silent now. We stared at
objects that had no earthly interest for us as if our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
lives depended on mastering their detail. We were
thus aware of a beautiful little Belgian house standing
back from the village street down a short turning,
a cream-coloured house with green shutters and
a roof of rose-red tiles, and a very small poplar
tree mounting guard beside it. This house and its
tree were vivid and very still. They stood back in
an atmosphere of their own, an atmosphere of perfect
but utterly unreal peace. And as long as our
memories endure, that house which we never saw
before, and shall probably never see again, is bound
up with the fate of Mrs. Torrence and Janet McNeil.</p>

<p>We thought we should have an hour to wait before
they came back, if they ever did come. We
waited for them during a whole dreadful lifetime.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>In something less than half an hour the military
ambulance came swinging round the turn of the
road, with Mrs. Torrence and the Kid, and the two
German wounded with them on the stretchers.</p>

<p>Those Germans never thought that they were going
to be saved. They couldn't get over it&mdash;that
two Englishwomen should have gone through their
fire, for them! As they were being carried through
the fire they said: "We shall never forget what
you've done for us. God will bless you for it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence asked them, "What will you do
for us if we are taken prisoner?"</p>

<p>And they said: "We will do all we can to save
you."</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>Antwerp is said to have fallen.</p>

<p>Antwerp is said to be holding its own well.<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>All evening the watching Taube has been hanging
over Ghent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence and Janet have gone back with the
ambulance to Melle.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Night.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sat</span> up all night with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>There is one night nurse for all the wards on
this floor, and she has a serious case to watch in
another room. But I can call her if I want help.
And there is the chemist who sleeps in the room
next door, who will come if I go in and wake him
up. And there are our own four doctors upstairs.
And the <i>infirmiers</i>. It ought to be all right.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it was the most terrible night
I have ever spent in my life; and I have lived
through a good many terrible nights in sick-rooms.
But no amount of amateur nursing can take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
place of training or of the self-confidence of knowing
you are trained. And even if you <i>are</i> trained,
no amount of medical nursing will prepare you for
a bad surgical case. To begin with, I had never
nursed a patient so tall and heavy that I couldn't
lift him by sheer strength and a sort of amateur
knack.</p>

<p>And though in theory it was reassuring to know
that you could call the night nurse and the chemist
and the four doctors and the <i>infirmiers</i>, in practice
it didn't work out quite so easily as it sounded.
When the night nurse came she couldn't lift any
more than I could; and she had a greater command
of discouraging criticism than of useful, practical
suggestion. And the chemist knew no more about
lifting than the night nurse. (Luckily none of us
pretended for an instant that we knew!) When I
had called up two of our hard-worked surgeons
each once out of his bed, I had some scruples about
waking them again. And it took four Belgian <i>infirmiers</i>
to do in five minutes what one surgeon
could do in as many seconds. And when the
chemist went to look for the <i>infirmiers</i> he was gone
for ages&mdash;he must have had to round them up
from every floor in the Hospital. Whenever any
of them went to look for anything, it took them
ages. It was as if for every article needed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
wards of that Hospital there was a separate and inaccessible
central depôt.<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>At one moment a small pillow had to be placed
in the hollow of my patient's back if he was to be
kept in that position on which I had been told his
life depended. When I sent the night nurse to look
for something that would serve, she was gone a
quarter of an hour, in which I realized that my
case was not the only case in the Hospital. For
a quarter of an hour I had to kneel by his bed with
my two arms thrust together under the hollow of his
back, supporting it. I had nothing at hand that was
small enough or firm enough but my arms.</p>

<p>That night I would have given everything I possess,
and everything I have ever done, to have been
a trained nurse.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, I had an atrocious cough,
acquired at the Hôtel de la Poste. The chemist
had made up some medicine for it, but the poor busy
dispensary clerk had forgotten to send it to my
room. I had to stop it by an expenditure of will
when I wanted every atom of will to keep my patient
quiet and send him to sleep, if possible, without his
morphia <i>piqûres</i>. He is only to have one if he is
restless or in pain.</p>

<p>And to-night he wanted more than ever to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
when he woke. And his conversation in the night
is even more lacerating than his conversation in the
day. For all the time, often in pain, always in extreme
discomfort, he is thinking of other people.</p>

<p>First of all he asked me if I had any books, and
I thought that he wanted me to read to him. I told
him I was afraid he mustn't be read to, he must go
to sleep. And he said: "I mean for you to read
yourself&mdash;to pass the time."</p>

<p>He is afraid that I shall be bored by sitting up
with him, that I shall tire myself, that I shall make
my cough worse. He asks me if I think he will ever
be well enough to play games. That is what he
has always wanted to do most.</p>

<p>And then he begins to tell me about his mother.</p>

<p>He tells me things that I have no right to put
down here.</p>

<p>There is nothing that I can do for him but to
will. And I will hard, or I pray&mdash;I don't know
which it is; your acutest willing and your intensest
prayer are indistinguishable. And it seems to work.
I will&mdash;or I pray&mdash;that he shall lie still without
morphia, and that he shall have no pain. And he
lies still, without pain. I will&mdash;or I pray&mdash;that
he shall sleep without morphia. And he sleeps (I
think that in spite of his extreme discomfort, he
must have slept the best part of the night). And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
because it seems to work, I will&mdash;or I pray&mdash;that
he shall get well.</p>

<p>There are many things that obstruct this process
as fast as it is begun: your sensation of sight and
touch; the swarms and streams of images that your
brain throws out; and the crushing obsession of
your fear. This last is like a dead weight that you
hold off you with your arms stretched out. Your
arms sink and drop under it perpetually and have to
be raised again. At last the weight goes. And the
sensations go, and the swarms and streams of
images go, and there is nothing before you and
around you but a clear blank darkness where your
will vibrates.</p>

<p>Only one avenue of sense is left open. You are
lost to the very memories of touch and sight, but
you are intensely conscious of every sound from
the bed, every movement of the sleeper. And while
one half of you only lives in that pure and effortless
vibration, the other half is aware of the least change
in the rhythm of his breathing.</p>

<p>It is by this rhythm that I can tell whether he
is asleep or awake. This rhythm of his breathing,
and the rhythm of his sleeping and his waking measure
out the night for me. It goes like one hour.</p>

<p>And yet I have spent months of nights watching
in this room. Its blond walls are as familiar to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
as the walls of rooms where I have lived a long
time; I know with a profound and intimate knowledge
every crinkle in the red shade of the electric
bulb that hangs on the inner wall between the two
beds, the shape and position of every object on the
night table in the little white-tiled dressing-room;
I know every trick of the inner and outer doors
leading to the corridor, and the long grey lane of
the corridor, and the room that I must go through
to find ice, and the face of the little ward-maid who
sleeps there, who wants to get up and break the ice
for me every time. I have known the little ward-maid
all my life; I have known the night nurse all
my life, with her white face and sharp black eyes,
and all my life I have not cared for her. All my
life I have known and cared only for the wounded
man on the bed.</p>

<p>I have known every sound of his voice and every
line of his face and hands (the face and hands that
he asks me to wash, over and over again, if I don't
mind), and the strong springing of his dark hair
from his forehead and every little feathery tuft of
beard on his chin. And I have known no other
measure of time than the rhythm of his breathing,
no mark or sign of time than the black crescent of
his eyelashes when the lids are closed, and the curling
blue of his eyes when they open. His eyes al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ways
smile as they open, as if he apologized for waking
when he knows that I want him to sleep. And
I have known these things so long that each one of
them is already like a separate wound in my
memory.<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He sums up for me all the heroism and
the agony and waste of the defence of Antwerp, all
the heroism and agony and waste of war.</p>

<p>About midnight [?] he wakes and tells me he
has had a jolly dream. He dreamed that he was
running in a field in England, running in a big race,
that he led the race and won it.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Sunday, 11th.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> bad symptom is disappearing. Towards
dawn it has almost gone. He really does seem
stronger.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>5 a.m.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> has had no return of pain or restlessness.
But he was to have a morphia <i>piqûre</i> at five o'clock,
and they have given it to him to make sure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>8 a.m.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night has not been so terrible, after all. It
has gone like an hour and I have left him sleeping.</p>

<p>I am not in the least bit tired; I never felt drowsy
once, and my cough has nearly gone.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>Antwerp has fallen.</p>

<p>Taube over Ghent in the night.</p>

<p>Six doctors have seen Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. They all say
he is ever so much better. They even say he may
live&mdash;that he has a good chance.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson is taking Mr. Foster to England this
morning.</p>

<p>Went back to the Hôtel Cecil to sleep for an hour
or two. An enormous oval table-top is leaning flat
against the wall; but by no possibility can it be set
up. Still, the landlord said he would find a table,
and he has found one.</p>

<p>Went back to the "Flandria" for lunch. In the
mess-room Janet tells me that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s case has
been taken out of my hands. I am not to try to
do any more nursing.</p>

<p>Little Janet looks as if she were trying to soften
a blow. But it isn't a blow. Far from it. It
is the end of an intolerable responsibility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commandant and the Chaplain started about
nine or ten this morning for Melle, and are not back
yet.</p>

<p>We expect that we may have to clear out of Ghent
before to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley, Mrs. Lambert and Janet have gone in
the second car to Melle.</p>

<p>I waited in all afternoon on the chance of being
taken when the Commandant comes and goes out
again.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>4.45.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> is not back yet. I am very anxious. The
Germans may be in Melle by now.</p>

<p>One of the old officials in peaked caps has called
on me solemnly this afternoon. He is the most
mysterious of them all, an old man with a white
moustache, who never seems to do anything but
hang about. He is certainly not an <i>infirmier</i>. He
called ostensibly to ask some question and remained
to talk. I think he thought he would pump me.
He began by asking if we women enjoyed going out
with the Field Ambulance; he supposed we felt very
daring and looked on the whole thing as an adventure.
I detected some sinister intention, and replied
that that was not exactly the idea; that our women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
went out to help to save the lives of the wounded
soldiers, and that they had succeeded in this object
over and over again; and that I didn't imagine they
thought of anything much except their duty. We
certainly were not out for amusement.</p>

<p>Then he took another line. He told me that the
reason why our Ambulance is to be put under the
charge of the British General here (we had heard
that the whole of the Belgian Army was shortly to
be under the control of the British, and the whole
of the Belgian Red Cross with it)&mdash;the reason
is that its behaviour in going into the firing-line
has been criticized. And when I ask him on
what grounds, it turns out that somebody thinks
there is a risk of our Ambulance drawing down
the fire on the lines it serves. I told him that in
all the time I had been with the Ambulance it had
never placed itself in any position that could possibly
have drawn down fire on the Belgians, and
that I had never heard of any single instance of
this danger; and I made him confess that there was
no proof or even rumour of any single instance
when it had occurred. I further told the old gentleman
very plainly that these things ought not to
be said or repeated, and that every man and woman
in the English Ambulance would rather lose their
own life than risk that of one Belgian soldier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman was somewhat flattened out
before he left me; having "<i>parfaitement compris</i>."</p>

<p>It is a delicious idea that Kitchener and Joffre
should be reorganizing the Allied Armies because
of the behaviour of our Ambulance.</p>

<p>There are Gordon Highlanders in Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>Went over to the Couvent de Saint Pierre, where
Miss Ashley-Smith is with her British wounded.
I had to warn her that the Germans may come in
to-night. I had told the Commandant about her
yesterday, and arranged with him that we should
take her and her British away in our Ambulance if
we have to go. I had to find out how many there
would be to take.</p>

<p>The Convent is a little way beyond the <i>Place</i>
on the boulevard. I knew it by the Red Cross
hanging from the upper windows. Everything is
as happy and peaceful here as if Ghent were not on
the eve of an invasion. The nuns took me to Miss
Ashley-Smith in her ward. I hardly knew her, for
she had changed the uniform of the British Field
Hospital<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> for the white linen of the Belgian Red
Cross. I found her in charge of the ward. Ab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>solutely
unperturbed by the news, she went on superintending
the disposal of a table of surgical instruments.
She would not consent to come with
us at first. But the nuns persuaded her that she
would do no good by remaining.</p>

<p>I am to come again and tell her what time to be
ready with her wounded, when we know whether
we are going and when.</p>

<p>Came back to the "Flandria" and finished entries
in my Day-Book.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Evening.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Commandant has come back from Melle;
but he is going there again almost directly. He has
been to the British lines, and heard for certain that
the Germans will be in Ghent before morning. We
have orders to clear out before two in the morning.
I am to have all his things packed by midnight.</p>

<p>The British Consul has left Ghent.</p>

<p>The news spread through the "Flandria."</p>

<p>Max has gone about all day with a scared, white
face. They say he is suffering from cold feet.
But I will not believe it. He has just appeared in
the mess-room and summoned me mysteriously.
He takes me along the corridor to that room of his
which he is so proud of. There is a brand-new uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>form
lying on the bed, the uniform of a French
soldier of the line. Max handles it with love and
holy adoration, as a priest handles his sacred vestments.
He takes it in his arms, he spreads before
me the grey-blue coat, the grey-blue trousers, and
his queer eyes are in their solemnity large and quiet
as dark moons.</p>

<p>Max is going to rejoin his regiment.</p>

<p>It is sheer nervous excitement that gave him that
wild, white face.</p>

<p>Max is confident that we shall meet again; and
I have a horrid vision of Max carried on a bloody
stretcher, a brutally wounded Max.</p>

<p>He has given me his address in Brussels, which
will not find him there for long enough: if ever.</p>

<p>Jean also is to rejoin his regiment.</p>

<p>Marie, the <i>bonne</i>, stands at the door of the service
room and watches us with frightened eyes. She
follows me into the mess-room and shuts the door.
The poor thing has been seized with panic, and her
one idea is to get away from Ghent. Can I find a
place for her on one of our ambulance cars? She
will squeeze in anywhere, she will stand outside on
the step. Will I take her back to England? She
will do any sort of work, no matter what, and she
won't ask for wages if only I will take her there.
I tell her we are not going to England. We are go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>ing
to Bruges. We have to follow the Belgian
Army wherever it is sent.</p>

<p>Then will I take her to Bruges? She has a
mother there.</p>

<p>It is ghastly. I have to tell her that it is impossible;
that there will be no place for her in the
ambulance cars, that they will be crammed with
wounded, that we will have to stand on the steps
ourselves, that I do not know how many we shall
have to take from the Convent, or how many from
the hospitals; that I can do nothing without the
Commandant's orders, and that the Commandant is
not here. And she pleads and implores. She cannot
believe that we can be so cruel, and I find my
voice growing hard and stern with sheer, wrenching
pity. At last I tell her that if there is room
I will see what can be done, but that I am afraid
that there will not be room. She stays, she clings,
trying to extort through pity a more certain promise,
and I have to tell her to go. She goes, looking
at me with the dull resentment of a helpless creature
whom I have hurt. The fact that she has left me
sick with pity will not do her any good. Nothing
can do her any good but that place on the ambulance
which I have no power to give her.</p>

<p>For Marie is not the only one.</p>

<p>I see all the servants in the "Flandria" coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
to me before the night is over, and clinging and
pleading for a place in the ambulance cars.</p>

<p>And this is only the beginning. After Marie
comes Janet McNeil. She, poor child, has surrendered
to the overpowering assault on her feelings
and has pledged herself to smuggle the four
young children of Madame &mdash;&mdash; into the ambulance
somehow. I don't see how it was possible for her
to endure the agony of refusing this request. But
what we are to do with four young children in cars
packed with wounded soldiers, through all the stages
of the Belgian Army's retreat&mdash;!</p>

<p>The next problem that faced me was the Commandant's
packing&mdash;how to get all the things he
had brought with him into one small Gladstone bag
and a sleeping-sack. There was a blue serge suit,
two sleeping-suits, a large Burberry, a great many
pocket-handkerchiefs, socks and stockings, an assortment
of neckties, a quantity of small miscellaneous
objects whose fugitive tendencies he proposed
to frustrate by confinement in a large tin
biscuit-box; there was the biscuit-box itself, a tobacco
tin, a packet of Gillette razors, a pipe, a
leather case containing some electric apparatus, and
a fat scarlet volume: Freud's "Psychopathology
of Everyday Life." All these things he had pointed
out to me as they lay flung on the bed or strewn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
about the room. He had impressed on me the absolute
necessity of packing every one of them, and
by the pathetic grouping around the Gladstone bag
of the biscuit-box, the tobacco-tin, the case of instruments
and Freud, I gathered that he believed
that they would all enter the bag placably and be
contained in it with ease.</p>

<p>The night is still young.</p>

<p>I pack the Gladstone bag. By alternate coaxing
and coercion Freud and the tobacco-tin and the
biscuit-box occupy it amicably enough; but the case
of instruments offers an unconquerable resistance.</p>

<p>The night is not quite so young as it has been,
and I think I must have left off packing to run over
to the Hôtel Cecil and pay my bill; for I remember
going out into the <i>Place</i> and seeing a crowd drawn
up in the middle of it before the "Flandria." An
official was addressing this crowd, ordering them
to give up their revolvers and any arms they had
on them.</p>

<p>The fate of Ghent depends on absolute obedience
to this order.</p>

<p>When I get back I find Mrs. Torrence downstairs
in the hall of the "Flandria." I ask her what
we had better do about our refugee children. She
says we can do nothing. There must be no refugee
children. How <i>can</i> there be in an ambulance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
packed with wounded men? When I tell her that
the children will certainly be there if somebody
doesn't do something to stop them, she goes off to
do it. I do not envy her her job. She is not enjoying
it herself. First of all she has got to break
it to Janet. And Janet will have to break it to the
mother.</p>

<p>As to poor Marie, she is out of the question. <i>I</i>
shall have to break it to Marie.</p>

<p>The night goes on. I sit with Mr. &mdash;&mdash; for a
little while. I have still to finish the Commandant's
packing; I have not yet begun my own, and
it is time that I should go round to the Convent to
tell Miss Ashley-Smith to be ready with her British
before two o'clock.</p>

<p>I sit with him for what seems a very long time.
It is appalling to me that the time should seem long.
For it is really such a little while, and when it is
over there will be nothing more that I shall ever
do for him. This thought is not prominent and
vivid; it is barely discernible; but it is there, a dull
background of pain under my anxiety for the safety
of the English over there in the Couvent de Saint
Pierre. It is more than time that I should go and
tell them to be ready.</p>

<p>He holds out his hands to be sponged "if I don't
mind." I sponge them over and over again with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
iced water and eau de Cologne, gently and very
slowly. I am afraid lest he should be aware that
there is any hurry. The time goes on, and my
anxiety becomes acuter every minute, till with each
slow, lingering turn of my hand I think, "If I don't
go soon it will be too late."</p>

<p>I hear that the children will be all right. Somebody
has had a <i>crise de nerfs</i>, and Janet was the
victim.</p>

<p>It is past midnight, and very dark. The <i>Place</i>
and the boulevards are deserted. I cannot see the
Red Cross flag hanging from the window of the
Convent. The boulevards look all the same in the
blackness, and I turn up the one to the left. I run
on and on very fast, but I cannot see the white flag
with the red cross anywhere; I run back, thinking
I must have passed it, turn and go on again.</p>

<p>There is nobody in sight. No sound anywhere
but the sound of my own feet running faster and
faster up the wrong boulevard.</p>

<p>At last I know I have gone too far, the houses are
entirely strange. I run back to the <i>Place</i> to get my
bearings, and start again. I run faster than ever.
I pass a solitary civilian coming down the boulevard.
The place is so empty and so still that he and I seem
to be the only things alive and awake in this quarter
of the town. As I pass he turns to look after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
me, wondering at the solitary lady running so fast
at this hour of the morning. I see the Red Cross
flag in the distance, and I come to a door that looks
like the door of the Convent. It <i>is</i> the door of the
Convent.</p>

<p>I ring the bell. I ring it many times. Nobody
comes.</p>

<p>I ring a little louder. A tired lay sister puts
her head out of an upper window and asks me what
I want. I tell her. She is rather cross and says
I've come to the wrong door. I must go to the
second door; and she puts her head in and shuts
the window with a clang that expresses her just resentment.</p>

<p>I go to the second door, and ring many times
again. And another lay sister puts her head out of
an upper window.</p>

<p>She is gentle but sleepy and very slow. She cannot
take it in all at once. She says they are all
asleep in the Convent, and she does not like to
wake them. She says this several times, so that I
may understand.</p>

<p>I am exasperated.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais, Madame&mdash;de grâce! C'est peut-être la
vie ou la mort!</i>"</p>

<p>The minute I've said it it sounds to me melo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>dramatic
and absurd. <i>I</i> am melodramatic and absurd,
with my running feet, and my small figure and
earnest, upturned face, standing under a Convent
wall at midnight, and talking about <i>la vie et la mort</i>.
It is too improbable. <i>I</i> am too improbable. I feel
that I am making a fuss out of all proportion to the
occasion. And I am sorry for frightening the poor
lay sister all for nothing.</p>

<p>Very soon, down the south-east road, the Germans
will be marching upon Ghent.</p>

<p>And I cannot realize it. The whole thing is too
improbable.</p>

<p>But the lay sister has understood this time. She
will go and wake the porteress. She is not at all
frightened.</p>

<p>I wait a little longer, and presently the porteress
opens the door. When she hears my message she
goes away, and returns after a little while with one
of the nuns.</p>

<p>They are very quiet, very kind, and absolutely
unafraid. They say that Miss Ashley-Smith and
her British wounded shall be ready before [?] two
o'clock.</p>

<p>I go back to the "Flandria."</p>

<p>The Commandant, who went out to Melle in
Tom's car, has not come back yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>I think Ursula Dearmer and Mrs. Lambert have
gone to bed. They are not taking the Germans very
seriously.</p>

<p>There is nobody in the mess-room but the other
three chauffeurs, Bert, Tom and Newlands. Newlands
has just come back from Ostend. They have
had no supper. We bustle about to find some.</p>

<p>We all know the Germans are coming into Ghent.
But we do not speak of it. We are all very polite,
almost supernaturally gentle, and very kind to each
other. The beautiful manners of Newlands are
conspicuous in this hour, the tragedy of which we
are affecting to ignore. I behave as if there was
nothing so important in the world as cutting bread
for Newlands. Newlands behaves as if there were
nothing so important as fetching a bottle of formamint,
which he has with him, to cure my cough.
(It has burst out again worse than ever after the
unnatural repression of last night.)</p>

<p>When the chauffeurs are provided with supper
I go into the Commandant's room and finish his
packing. The ties, the pocket-handkerchiefs and
the collars are all safe in the Gladstone bag.
Only the underclothing and the suits remain and
there is any amount of room for them in the hold-all.</p>

<p>I roll up the blue serge coat, and the trousers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the waistcoat very smooth and tight, also the underclothes.
It seems very simple. I have only got to
put them in the hold-all and then roll it up, smooth
and tight, too&mdash;</p>

<p>It would have been simple, if the hold-all had
been a simple hold-all and if it had been nothing
more. But it was also a sleeping-bag and a field-tent.
As sleeping-bag, it was provided with a thick
blanket which took up most of the room inside, and
a waterproof sheet which was part of itself. As
field-tent, it had large protruding flanges, shaped
like jib-sails, and a complicated system of ropes.</p>

<p>First of all I tucked in the jib-sails and ropes and
laid them as flat as might be on the bottom of the
sleeping-bag, with the blanket on the top of them.
Then I packed the clothes on the top of the blanket
and turned it over them to make all snug; I buttoned
up the waterproof sheet over everything, rolled up
the hold-all and secured it with its straps. This
was only done by much stratagem and strength, by
desperate tugging and pushing, and by lying flat on
my waist on the rolled-up half to keep it quiet while
I brought the loose half over. No sooner had I
secured the hold-all by its straps than I realized that
it was no more a hold-all than it was a sleeping-bag
and a field tent, and that its contents were exposed
to the weather down one side, where they bulged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
through the spaces that yawned between the buttons,
strained almost to bursting.</p>

<p>I still believed in the genius that had devised this
trinity. Clearly the jib-sails which made it a field-tent
were intended to serve also as the pockets of
the hold-all. I had done wrong to flatten them out
and tuck them in, frustrating the fulfilment of their
function. It was not acting fairly by the inventor.</p>

<p>I unpacked the hold-all, I mean the field-tent.</p>

<p>Then, with the Commandant's clothes again lying
round me on the floor, I grappled with the mystery
of the jib-sails and their cords. The jib-sails and
their cords were, so to speak, the heart of this infernal
triple entity.</p>

<p>They were treacherous. They had all the appearance
of pockets, but owing to the intricate and
malign relations of their cords, it was impossible to
deal faithfully with them on this footing. When
the contents had been packed inside them, the field-tent
asserted itself as against the hold-all and refused
to roll up. And I am sure that if the field-tent
had had to be set up in a field in a hurry, the
hold-all and the sleeping-bag would have arisen and
insisted on their consubstantial rights.</p>

<p>I unpacked the field-tent and packed it all over
again exactly as I had packed it before, but more
carefully, swearing gently and continuously, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
tugged with my arms and pushed with my knees,
and pressed hard on it with my waist to keep it still.
I cursed the day when I had first heard of it; I
cursed myself for giving it to the Commandant;
more than all I cursed the combined ingenuity and
levity of its creator, who had indulged his fantasy at
our expense, without a thought to the actual conditions
of the retreat of armies and of ambulances.</p>

<p>And in the middle of it all Janet came in, and
curled herself up in a corner, and forecast luridly
and inconsolably the possible fate of her friends,
the nurses in the "Flandria." For the moment her
coolness and her wise impassivity had gone. Her
behaviour was lacerating.</p>

<p>This was the very worst moment we had come to
yet.<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>And it seemed that Ursula Dearmer and Mrs.
Lambert had gone to bed, regardless of the retreat
from Ghent.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the small hours of the morning the
Commandant came back from Melle.<a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>It is nearly two o'clock. Downstairs, in the great
silent hall two British wounded are waiting for some
ambulance to take them to the Station. They are
sitting bolt upright on chairs near the doorway,
their heads nodding with drowsiness. One or two
Belgian Red Cross men wait beside them. Opposite
them, on three other chairs, the three doctors, Dr.
Haynes, Dr. Bird and Dr. &mdash;&mdash; sit waiting for our
own ambulance to take them. They have been up
all night and are utterly exhausted. They sit, fast
asleep, with their heads bowed on their breasts.</p>

<p>Outside, the darkness has mist and a raw cold
sting in it.</p>

<p>A wretched ambulance wagon drawn by two
horses is driven up to the door. It had a hood once,
but the hood has disappeared and only the naked
hoops remain. The British wounded from two [?]
other hospitals are packed in it in two rows. They
sit bolt upright under the hoops, exposed to mist and
to the raw cold sting of the night; some of them
wear their blankets like shawls over their shoulders
as they were taken from their beds. The shawls
and the head bandages give these British a strange,
foreign look, infinitely helpless, infinitely pitiful.</p>

<p>Nobody seems to be out there but Mrs. Torrence
and one or two Belgian Red Cross men. She and I
help to get our two men taken gently out of the hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and stowed away in the ambulance wagon. There
are not enough blankets. We try to find some.</p>

<p>At the last minute two bearers come forward,
carrying a third. He is tall and thin; he is wrapped
in a coat flung loosely over his sleeping-jacket; he
wears a turban of bandages; his long bare feet stick
out as he is carried along. It is Cameron, my poor
Highlander, who was shot through the brain.</p>

<p>They lift him, very gently, into the wagon.</p>

<p>Then, very gently, they lift him out again.</p>

<p>This attempt to save him is desperate. He is
dying.</p>

<p>They carry him up the steps and stand him there
with his naked feet on the stone. It is anguish to see
those thin white feet on the stone; I take off my
coat and put it under them.</p>

<p>It is all I can do for him.</p>

<p>Presently they carry him back into the Hospital.</p>

<p>They can't find any blankets. I run over to the
Hôtel Cecil for my thick, warm travelling-rug to
wrap round the knees of the wounded, shivering in
the wagon.</p>

<p>It is all I can do for them.</p>

<p>And presently the wagon is turned round, slowly,
almost solemnly, and driven off into the darkness
and the cold mist, with its load of weird and piteous
figures, wrapped in blankets like shawls. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
bandages show blurred white spots in the mist, and
they are gone.</p>

<p>It is horrible.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>I am reminded that I have not packed yet, nor
dressed for the journey. I go over and pack and
dress. I leave behind what I don't need and it takes
seven minutes. There is something sad and terrible
about the little hotel, and its proprietors and their
daughter, who has waited on me. They have so much
the air of waiting, of being on the eve. They hang
about doing nothing. They sit mournfully in a corner
of the half-darkened restaurant. As I come
and go they smile at me with the patient Belgian
smile that says, "<i>C'est triste, n'est-ce pas?</i>" and no
more.</p>

<p>The landlord puts on his soft brown felt hat and
carries my luggage over to the "Flandria." He
stays there, hanging about the porch, fascinated by
these preparations for departure. There is the
same terrible half-darkness here, the same expectant
stillness. Now and then the servants of the hospital
look at each other and there are whisperings, mutterings.
They sound sinister somehow and inimical.
Or perhaps I imagine this because I do not take
kindly to retreating. Anyhow I am only aware of
them afterwards. For now it is time to go and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
fetch Miss Ashley-Smith and her three wounded
men from the Convent.</p>

<p>Tom has come up with his first ambulance car.
He is waiting for orders in the porch. His enormous
motor goggles are pushed up over the peak
of his cap. They make it look like some formidable
helmet. They give an air of mastership to Tom's
face. At this last hour it wears its expression of
righteous protest, of volcanic patience, of exasperated
discipline.</p>

<p>The Commandant is nowhere to be seen. And
every minute of his delay increases Tom's sense of
tortured integrity.</p>

<p>I tell Tom that he is to drive me at once to the
Couvent de Saint Pierre. He wants to know what
for.</p>

<p>I tell him it is to fetch Miss Ashley-Smith and
three British wounded.</p>

<p>He shrugs his shoulders. He knows nothing
about the Couvent de Saint Pierre and Miss Ashley-Smith
and three British wounded, and his shrug
implies that he cares less.</p>

<p>And he says he has no orders to go and fetch
them.</p>

<p>I perceive that in this supreme moment I am up
against Tom's superstition. He won't move anywhere
without orders. It is his one means of put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>ting
himself in the right and everybody else in the
wrong.</p>

<p>And the worst of it is he <i>is</i> right.</p>

<p>I am also up against Tom's sex prejudices. I
remember that he is said to have sworn with an oath
that he wasn't going to take orders from any
woman.</p>

<p>And the Commandant is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Tom sticks to the ledge of the porch and stares
at me defiantly. The servants of the Hospital come
out and look at us. They are so many reinforcements
to Tom's position.</p>

<p>I tell him that the arrangement has been made
with the Commandant's consent, and I repeat firmly
that he is to get into his car this minute and drive
to the Couvent de Saint Pierre.</p>

<p>He says he does not know where the Convent is.
It may be anywhere.</p>

<p>I tell him where it is, and he says again he hasn't
got orders.</p>

<p>I stand over him and with savage and violent
determination I say: "You've got them <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>And, actually, Tom obeys. He says, "<i>All</i> right,
all right, all right," very fast, and humps his shoulders
and slouches off to his car. He cranks it up
with less vehemence than I have yet known him
bring to the starting of any car.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>We get in. Then, and not till then, I am placable.
I say: "You see, Tom, it wouldn't do to leave
that lady and three British wounded behind, would
it?"</p>

<p>What he says about orders then is purely by way
of apology.</p>

<p>Regardless of my instructions, he does what I did
and dashes up the wrong boulevard as if the Germans
were even now marching into the <i>Place</i> behind
him. But he works round somehow and we
arrive.</p>

<p>They are all there, ready and waiting. And the
Mother Superior and two of her nuns are in the
corridor. They bring out glasses of hot milk for
everybody. They are so gentle and so kind that
I recall with agony my impatience when I rang at
their gate. Even familiar French words desert me
in this crisis, and I implore Miss Ashley-Smith to
convey my regrets for my rudeness. Their only
answer is to smile and press hot milk on me. I
am glad of it, for I have been so absorbed in the
drama of preparation that I have entirely forgotten
to eat anything since lunch.</p>

<p>The wounded are brought along the passage.
We help them into the ambulance. Two, Williams
and &mdash;&mdash;, are only slightly wounded; they can sit
up all the way. But the third, Fisher, is wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
in the head. Sometimes he is delirious and must
be looked after. A fourth man is dying and must
be left behind.</p>

<p>Then we say good-bye to the nuns.</p>

<p>The other ambulance cars are drawn up in the
<i>Place</i> before the "Flandria," waiting. For the
first time I hate the sight of them. This feeling
is inexplicable but profound.</p>

<p>We arrange for the final disposal of the wounded
in one of the new Daimlers, where they can all lie
down. Mrs. Torrence comes out and helps us.
The Commandant is not there yet. Dr. Haynes
and Dr. Bird pack Dr. &mdash;&mdash; away well inside the
car. They are very quiet and very firm and refuse
to travel otherwise than together. Mrs. Torrence
goes with the wounded.</p>

<p>I go into the Hospital and upstairs to our quarters
to see if anything has been left behind. If I can
find Marie we must take her. There is room, after
all.</p>

<p>But Marie is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Nobody is to be seen but the Belgian night nurses
on duty, watching, one on each landing at the entrance
to her corridor. They smile at me gravely
and sadly as they say good-bye.</p>

<p>I have left many places, many houses, many people
behind me, knowing that I shall never see them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
again. But of all leave-takings this seems to me
the worst. For those others I have been something,
done something that absolves me. But for these
and for this place I have not done anything, and
now there is not anything to be done.</p>

<p>I go slowly downstairs. Each flight is a more
abominable descent. At each flight I stand still and
pull myself together to face the next nurse on the
next landing. At the second story I go past without
looking. I know every stain on the floor of the
corridor there as you turn to the right. The number
of the door and the names on the card beside
it have made a pattern on my brain.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>It is quarter to three.</p>

<p>They are all ready now. The Commandant is
there giving the final orders and stowing away the
nine wounded he has brought from Melle. The
hall of the Hospital is utterly deserted. So is the
<i>Place</i> outside it. And in the stillness and desolation
our going has an air of intolerable secrecy, of
furtive avoidance of fate. This Field Ambulance
of ours abhors retreat.</p>

<p>It is dark with the black darkness before dawn.</p>

<p>And the Belgian Red Cross guides have all gone.
There is nobody to show us the roads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>At the last minute we find a Belgian soldier who
will take us as far as Ecloo.</p>

<p>The Commandant has arranged to stay at Ecloo
for a few hours. Some friends there have offered
him their house. The wounded are to be put up at
the Convent. Ecloo is about half-way between
Ghent and Bruges.</p>

<p>We start. Tom's car goes first with the Belgian
soldier in front. Ursula Dearmer, Mrs. Lambert,
Miss Ashley-Smith and Mr. Riley and I are
inside. The Commandant sits, silent, wrapped in
meditation, on the step.</p>

<p>We are not going so very fast, not faster than
the three cars behind us, and the slowest of the
three (the Fiat with the hard tyres, carrying the
baggage) sets the pace. We must keep within their
sight or they may lose their way. But though we
are not really going fast, the speed seems intolerable,
especially the speed that swings us out of sight of
the "Flandria." You think that is the worst.
But it isn't. The speed with its steady acceleration
grows more intolerable with every mile. Your sense
of safety grows intolerable.</p>

<p>You never knew that safety could hurt like this.</p>

<p>Somewhere on this road the Belgian Army has
gone before us. We have got to go with it. We
have had our orders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>That thought consoles you, but not for long.
You may call it following the Belgian Army. But
the Belgian Army is retreating, and you are retreating
with it. There is nothing else you can do;
but that does not make it any better. And this
speed of the motor over the flat roads, this speed
that cuts the air, driving its furrow so fast that the
wind rushes by you like strong water, this speed
that so inspired and exalted you when it brought
you into Flanders, when it took you to Antwerp
and Baerlaere and Lokeren and Melle, this vehement
and frightful and relentless speed is the thing that
beats you down and tortures you. For several
hours, ever since you had your orders to pack up
and go, you have been working with no other purpose
than this going; you have contemplated it
many times with equanimity, with indifference; you
knew all along that it was not possible to stay in
Ghent for ever; and when you were helping to get
the wounded into the ambulances you thought it
would be the easiest thing in the world to get in
yourself and go with them; when you had time to
think about it you were even aware of looking forward
with pleasure to the thrill of a clean run before
the Germans. You never thought, and nobody
could possibly have told you, that it would be like
this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>I never thought, and nobody could possibly have
told me, that I was going to behave as I did then.</p>

<p>The thing began with the first turn of the road
that hid the "Flandria." Up till that moment,
whatever I may have felt about the people we had
to leave behind us, as long as none of our field-women
were left behind, I had not the smallest
objection to being saved myself. And if it had occurred
to me to stay behind for the sake of one
man who couldn't be moved and who had the best
surgeon in the Hospital and the pick of the nursing-staff
to look after him, I think I should have disposed
of the idea as sheer sentimentalism. When
I was with him to-night I could think of nothing
but the wounded in the Couvent de Saint Pierre.
And afterwards there had been so much to do.</p>

<p>And now that there was nothing more to do, I
couldn't think of anything but that one man.</p>

<p>The night before came back to me in a vision,
or rather an obsession, infinitely more present, more
visible and palpable than this night that we were
living in. The light with the red shade hung just
over my head on my right hand; the blond walls
were round me; they shut me in alone with the
wounded man who lay stretched before me on the
bed. And the moments were measured by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
rhythm of his breathing, and by the closing and
opening of his eyes.</p>

<p>I thought, he will open his eyes to-night and look
for me and I shall not be there. He will know
that he has been left to the Belgians, who cannot
understand him, whom he cannot understand.
And he will think that I have betrayed him.</p>

<p>I felt as if I <i>had</i> betrayed him.</p>

<p>I am sitting between Mr. Riley and Miss Ashley-Smith.
Mr. Riley is ill; he has got blood-poisoning
through a cut in his hand. Every now and then I
remember him, and draw the rug over his knees
as it slips. Miss Ashley-Smith, tired with her night
watching, has gone to sleep with her head on my
shoulder, where it must be horribly jolted and
shaken by my cough, which of course chooses this
moment to break out again. I try to get into a
position that will rest her better; and between her
and Mr. Riley I forget for a second.</p>

<p>Then the obsession begins again, and I am shut
in between the blond walls with the wounded man.</p>

<p>I feel his hand and arm lying heavily on my
shoulder in the attempt to support me as I kneel
by his bed with my arms stretched out together
under the hollow of his back, as we wait for the
pillow that never comes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite certain that I have betrayed him.</p>

<p>It seems to me then that nothing that could happen
to me in Ghent could be more infernal than
leaving it. And I think that when the ambulance
stops to put down the Belgian soldier I will get out
and walk back with him to Ghent.</p>

<p>Every half-mile I think that the ambulance will
stop to put down the Belgian soldier.</p>

<p>But the ambulance does not stop. It goes on and
on, and we have got to Ecloo before we seem to
have put three miles between us and Ghent.</p>

<p>Still, though I'm dead tired when we get there,
I can walk three miles easily. I do not feel at all
insane with my obsession. On the contrary, these
moments are moments of exceptional lucidity.<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
While the Commandant goes to look for the Convent
I get out and look for the Belgian soldier.
Other Belgian soldiers have joined him in the village
street.</p>

<p>I tell him I want to go back to Ghent. I ask
him how far it is to walk, and if he will take me.
And he says it is twenty kilometres. The other
soldiers say, too, it is twenty kilometres. I had
thought it couldn't possibly be more than four or
five at the outside. And I am just sane enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
know that I can't walk as far as that if I'm to be
any good when I get there.</p>

<p>We wait in the village while they find the Convent
and take the wounded men there; we wait
while the Commandant goes off in the dark to find
his friend's house.</p>

<p>The house stands in a garden somewhere beyond
the railway station, up a rough village street and a
stretch of country road. It is about four in the
morning when we get there. A thin ooze of light
is beginning to leak through the mist. The mist
holds it as a dark cloth holds a fluid that bleaches it.</p>

<p>There is something queer about this light. There
is something queer, something almost inimical,
about the garden, as if it tried to protect itself by
enchantment from the fifteen who are invading it.
The mist stands straight up from the earth like a
high wall drawn close about the house; it blocks
with dense grey stuff every inch of space between
the bushes and trees; they are thrust forward rank
upon rank, closing in upon the house; they loom
enormous and near. A few paces further back
they appear as without substance in the dense grey
stuff that invests them; their tops are tangled and
lost in a web of grey. In this strange garden it is
as if space itself had solidified in masses, and solid
objects had become spaces between.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>When your eyes get used to this curious inversion
it is as if the mist was no longer a wall but a
growth; the garden is the heart of a jungle bleached
by enchantment and struck with stillness and cold;
a tangle of grey; a muffled, huddled and stifled
bower, all grey, and webbed and laced with grey.</p>

<p>The door of the house opens and the effect of
queerness, of inimical magic disappears.</p>

<p>Mr. E., our kind Dutch host, and Mrs. E., our
kind English hostess, have got up out of their beds
to receive us. This hospitality of theirs is not a
little thing when you think that their house is to be
invaded by Germans, perhaps to-day.<a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>They do not allow you to think of it. For all
you are to see of the tragedy they and their house
might be remaining at Ecloo in leisure and perfect
hospitality and peace. Only, as they see us pouring
in over their threshold a hovering twinkle in
their kind eyes shows that they are not blind to the
comic aspect of retreats.</p>

<p>They have only one spare bedroom, which they
offer; but they have filled their drawing-room with
blankets; piles and piles of white fleecy blankets on
chairs and sofas and on the floor. And they have
built up a roaring fire. It is as if they were suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>couring
fifteen survivors of shipwreck or of earthquake,
or the remnants of a forlorn hope. To be
sure, we are flying from Ghent, but we have only
flown twenty kilometres as yet.</p>

<p>However, most of the Corps have been up all
night for several nights, and the mist outside is a
clinging and a biting mist, and everybody is grateful.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the look of the E.s' drawing-room,
smothered in blankets and littered with the
members of the Corps, who lay about it in every
pathetic posture of fatigue. A group of seven or
eight snuggled down among the blankets on the floor
in front of the hearth like a camp before a campfire.
Janet McNeil, curled up on one window-seat,
and Ursula Dearmer, rolled in a blanket on the other,
had the heart-rending beauty of furry animals under
torpor. The chauffeurs Tom and Bert made themselves
entirely lovable by going to sleep bolt upright
on dining-room chairs on the outer ring of the
camp. The E.s' furniture came in where it could
with fantastic and incongruous effect.</p>

<p>I don't know how I got through the next three
hours, for my obsession came back on me again
and again, and as soon as I shut my eyes I saw
the face and eyes of the wounded man. I remember
sitting part of the time beside Miss Ashley-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>Smith,
wide-awake, in a corner of the room behind
Bert's chair. I remember wandering about
the E.s' house. I must have got out of it, for I
also remember finding myself in their garden, at
sunrise.</p>

<p>And I remember the garden, though I was not
perfectly aware of it at the time. It had a divine
beauty, a serenity that refused to enter into, to
ally itself in any way with an experience tainted
by the sadness of the retreat from Ghent.</p>

<p>But because of its supernatural detachment and
tranquillity and its no less supernatural illumination
I recalled it the more vividly afterwards.</p>

<p>It was full of tall bushes and little slender trees
standing in a delicate light. The mist had cleared
to the transparency of still water, so still that under
it the bushes and the trees stood in a cold, quiet
radiance without a shimmer. The light itself was
intensely still. What you saw was not the approach
of light, but its mysterious arrest. It was held
suspended in crystalline vapour, in thin shafts of
violet and gold, clear as panes; it was caught and
lifted upwards by the high bushes and the slender
trees; it was veiled in the silver-green masses of
their tops. Every green leaf and every blade of
grass was a vessel charged. It was not so much
that the light revealed these things as that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
things revealed the light. There was no kindling
touch, no tremor of dawn in that garden. It was
as if it had removed the walls and put off the lacing
webs and the thick cloths of grey stuff by some
mystic impulse of its own, as if it maintained itself
in stillness by an inner flame. Only the very
finest tissues yet clung to it, to show that it was
the same garden that disclosed itself in this clarity
and beauty.</p>

<p>The next thing I remember is the Chaplain coming
to me and our going together into the E.s'
dining-room, and Miss Ashley-Smith's joining us
there. My malady was contagious and she had
caught it, but with no damage to her self-control.</p>

<p>She says very simply and quietly that she is going
back to Ghent. And the infection spreads to
the Chaplain. He says that neither of us is going
back to Ghent, but that he is going. The poor
boy tries to arrange with us how he may best do
it, in secrecy, without poisoning the Commandant<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and the whole Ambulance with the spirit of return.
With difficulty we convince him that it would be
useless for any man to go. He would be taken
prisoner the minute he showed his nose in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
"Flandria" and set to dig trenches till the end of
the War.</p>

<p>Then he says, if only he had his cassock with
him. They would respect <i>that</i> (which is open to
doubt).</p>

<p>We are there a long time discussing which of
us is going back to Ghent. Miss Ashley-Smith is
fertile and ingenious in argument. She is a nurse,
and I and the Chaplain are not. She has friends in
Ghent who have not been warned, whom she must
go back to. In any case, she says, it was a toss-up
whether she went or stayed.</p>

<p>And while we are still arguing, we go out on
the road that leads to the village, to find the ambulances
and see if any of the chauffeurs will take
us back to Ghent. I am not very hopeful about
the means of transport. I do not think that Tom
or any of the chauffeurs will move, this time, without
orders from the Commandant. I do not think
that the Commandant will let any of us go except
himself.</p>

<p>And Miss Ashley-Smith says if only she had a
horse.</p>

<p>If she had a horse she would be in Ghent in no
time. Perhaps, if none of the chauffeurs will take
her back, she can find a horse in the village.</p>

<p>She keeps on saying very quietly and simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
that she is going, and explaining the reasons why
she should go rather than anybody else. And I
bring forward every reason I can think of why she
should do nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>I abhor the possibility of her going back instead
of me; but I am not yet afraid of it. I do not yet
think seriously that she will do it. I do not see
how she is going to, if the chauffeurs refuse to take
her. (I do not see how, in this case, I am to go
myself.) And I do not imagine for one moment
that she will find a horse. Still, I am vaguely uneasy.
And the Chaplain doesn't make it any better
by backing her up and declaring that as she
will be more good than either of us when she gets
there, her going is the best thing that in the circumstances
can be done.</p>

<p>And in the end, with an extreme quietness and
simplicity, she went.</p>

<p>We had not yet found the ambulance cars, and
it seemed pretty certain that Miss Ashley-Smith
would not get her horse any more than the Chaplain
could get his cassock.</p>

<p>And then, just when we thought the difficulties
of transport were insuperable, we came straight on
the railway lines and the station, where a train
had pulled up on its way to Ghent. Miss Ashley-Smith
got on to the train. I got on too, to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
with her, and the Chaplain, who is abominably
strong, put his arms round my waist and pulled me
off.</p>

<p>I have never ceased to wish that I had hung on
to that train.</p>

<p>On our way back to the E.s' house we met the
Commandant and told him what had happened. I
said I thought it was the worst thing that had happened
yet. It wasn't the smallest consolation when
he said it was the most sensible solution.</p>

<p>And when Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; for fifteen consecutive
seconds took the view that I had decoyed Miss
Ashley-Smith out on to that accursed road in order
to send her to Ghent, and deliberately persuaded
her to go back to the "Flandria" instead of me,
for fifteen consecutive seconds I believed that this
diabolical thing was what I had actually done.</p>

<p>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s indignation never blazes away for
more than fifteen seconds; but while the conflagration
lasts it is terrific. And on circumstantial evidence
the case was black against me. When last
seen, Miss Ashley-Smith was entirely willing to be
saved. She goes out for a walk with me along
a quiet country road, and the next thing you hear
is that she has gone back to Ghent. And since,
actually and really, it was my obsession that had
passed into her, I felt that if I had taken Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Ashley-Smith down that road and murdered her in
a dyke my responsibility wouldn't have been a bit
worse, if as bad.</p>

<p>And it seemed to me that all the people scattered
among the blankets in that strange room, those that
still lay snuggling down amiably in the warmth, and
those that had started to their feet in dismay, and
those that sat on chairs upright and apart, were
hostile with a just and righteous hostility, that they
had an intimate knowledge of my crime, and had
risen up in abhorrence of the thing I was.</p>

<p>And somewhere, as if they were far off in some
blessed place on the other side of this nightmare,
I was aware of the merciful and pitiful faces of
Mrs. Lambert and Janet McNeil.</p>

<p>Then, close beside me, there was a sudden heaving
of the Chaplain's broad shoulders as he faced the
room.</p>

<p>And I heard him saying, in the same voice in
which he had declared that he was going to hold
Matins, that it wasn't my fault at all&mdash;that it was
<i>he</i> who had persuaded Miss Ashley-Smith to go
back to Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chaplain has a moral nerve that never fails
him.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Torrence says that she is going back
to protect Miss Ashley-Smith, and Ursula Dearmer
says that she is going back to protect Mrs. Torrence,
and somebody down in the blankets remarks
that the thing was settled last night, and that all
this going back is simply rotten.</p>

<p>I can only repeat that it is all my fault, and that
therefore, if Mrs. Torrence goes back, nobody is
going back with her but me.</p>

<p>And there can be no doubt that three motor ambulances,
with possibly the entire Corps inside them,
certainly with the five women and the Chaplain and
the Commandant, would presently have been seen
tearing along the road to Ghent, one in violent pursuit
of the other, if we had not telephoned and received
news of Miss Ashley-Smith's safe arrival at
the "Flandria," and orders that no more women
were to return to Ghent.</p>

<p>Among all the variously assorted anguish of that
halt at Ecloo the figures and the behaviour of Mrs.
E. and her husband and their children are beautiful
to remember&mdash;their courtesy, their serenity, their
gentle and absolving wonder that anybody should
see anything in the least frightful or distressing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
or even disconcerting and unusual, in the situation;
the little girl who sat beside me, showing me her
picture-book of animals, accepting gravely and earnestly
all that you had to tell her about the ways
of squirrels, of kangaroos and opossums, while we
waited for the ambulance cars to take us to Bruges;
the boy who ran after us as we went, and stood
looking after us and waving to us in the lane; the
aspect of that Flemish house and garden as we left
them&mdash;there is no word that embraces all these
things but beauty.</p>

<p>We stopped in the village to take up our wounded
from the Convent. The nuns brought us through
a long passage and across a little court to the refectory,
which had been turned into a ward. Bowls
steaming with the morning meal for the patients
stood on narrow tables between the two rows of
beds. Each bed was hung round and littered with
haversacks, boots, rifles, bandoliers and uniforms
bloody and begrimed. Except for the figures of
the nuns and the aspect of its white-washed walls
and its atmosphere of incorruptible peace, the place
might have been a barracks or the dormitory in a
night lodging, rather than a convent ward.</p>

<p>When we had found and dressed our men, we
led them out as we had come. As we went we saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
framed through some open doorway, sunlight and
vivid green, and the high walls and clipped alleys
of the Convent garden.</p>

<p>Of all our sad contacts and separations, these
leave-takings at the convents were the saddest.
And it was not only that this place had the same
poignant and unbearable beauty as the place we had
just left, but its beauty was unique. You felt that
if the friends you had just left were turned out
of their house and garden to-morrow, they might
still return some day. But here you saw a carefully
guarded and fragile loveliness on the very
eve of its dissolution. The place was fairly saturated
with holiness, and the beauty of holiness was
in the faces and in every gesture of the nuns. And
you felt that they and their faces and their gestures
were impermanent, that this highly specialized form
of holiness had continued with difficulty until now,
that it hung by a single thread to a world that had
departed very far from it.</p>

<p>Yet, for the moment while you looked at it, it
maintained itself in perfection.</p>

<p>We shall never know all that the War has annihilated.
But for that moment of time while it
lasted, the Convent at Ecloo annihilated the nineteenth
and eighteenth centuries, every century be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>tween
now and the fifteenth. What you saw was
a piece of life cut straight out of the Middle Ages.
What you felt was the guarded and hidden beauty
of the Middle Ages, the beauty of obedience, simplicity
and chastity, of souls set apart and dedicated,
the whole insoluble secret charm of the cloistered
life. The very horror of the invasion that threatened
it at this hour of the twentieth century was
a horror of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>But these devoted women did not seem aware
of it. The little high-bred English nun who conducted
us talked politely and placidly of England
and of English things as of things remembered with
a certain mortal affection but left behind without
regret. It was as if she contemplated the eternal
continuance of the Convent at Ecloo with no break
in its divine tranquillity. One sister went so far
as to express the hope that their Convent would be
spared. It was as if she were uttering some merely
perfunctory piety. The rest, without ceasing from
their ministrations, looked up at us and smiled.</p>

<p class="centerspread">········</p>

<p>On the way up to Bruges we passed whole regiments
of the Belgian Army in retreat. They
trooped along in straggling disorder, their rifles at
trail; behind them the standard-bearers trudged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
carrying the standard furled and covered with black.
The speed of our cars as we overtook them was
more insufferable than ever.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Bruges.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> thought that the Belgian Army would be
quartered in Bruges, and that we should find a
hospital there and serve the Army from that base.</p>

<p>We took our wounded to the Convent, and set
out to find quarters for ourselves in the town. We
had orders to meet at the Convent again at a certain
hour.</p>

<p>Most of the Corps were being put up at the Convent.
The rest of us had to look for rooms.</p>

<p>In the search I got separated from the Corps, and
wandered about the streets of Bruges with much
interest and a sense of great intimacy and leisure.
By the time I had found a <i>pension</i> in a narrow
street behind the market-place, I felt it to be quite
certain that we should stay in Bruges at least as
long as we had stayed in Ghent, and what moments
I could spare from the obsession of Ghent I spent
in contemplating the Belfry. Very soon it was time
to go back to the Convent. The way to the Convent
was through many tortuous streets, but I was
going in the right direction, accompanied by a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Flamand and her husband, when at the turn by the
canal bridge I was nearly run over by one of our
own ambulance cars. It was Bert's car, and he was
driving with fury and perturbation away from the
Convent and towards the town. Janet McNeil was
with him. They stopped to tell me that we had
orders to clear out of Bruges. The Germans had
taken Ghent and were coming on to Bruges. We
had orders to go on to Ostend.</p>

<p>We found the rest of the cars drawn up in a
street near the Convent. We had not been two
hours in Bruges, and we left it, if anything, quicker
than we had come in. The flat land fairly dropped
away before our speed. I sat on the back step of
the leading car, and I shall never forget the look
of those ambulances, three in a line, as they came
into sight scooting round the turns on the road to
Ostend.</p>

<p>Besides the wounded we had brought from Ghent,
we took with us three footsore Tommies whom we
had picked up in Bruges. They had had a long
march. The stoutest, biggest and most robust of
these three fainted just as we drew up in the courtyard
of the <i>Kursaal</i> at Ostend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Ostend.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Kursaal</i> had been taken by some English
and American women and turned into a Hospital.
It was filled already to overflowing, but they found
room for our wounded for the night. Ostend was
to be evacuated in the morning. In fact, we were
considered to be running things rather fine by staying
here instead of going on straight to Dunkirk.
It was supposed that if the Germans were not yet
in Bruges they might be there any minute.</p>

<p>But we had had so many premature orders to
clear out, and the Germans had always been hours
behind time, and we judged it a safe risk. Besides,
there were forty-seven Belgian wounded in Bruges,
and three of our ambulance cars were going back
to fetch them.</p>

<p>There was some agitation as to who would and
who wouldn't be allowed to go back to Bruges.
The Commandant was at first inclined to reject his
Secretary as unfit. But if you take him the right
way he is fairly tractable, and I managed to convince
him that nothing but going back to Bruges
could make up for my failure to go back to Ghent.
He earned my everlasting gratitude by giving me
leave. As for Mrs. Torrence, she had no difficulty.
She was obviously competent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, just as I was congratulating myself that
the shame of Ecloo was to be wiped out (to say
nothing of that ignominious overthrow at Melle),
there occurred a <i>contretemps</i> that made our ambulance
conspicuous among the many ambulances in
the courtyard of the Hospital.</p>

<p>We had reckoned without the mistimed chivalry
of our chauffeurs.</p>

<p>They had all, even Tom, been quite pathetically
kind and gentle during and ever since the flight
from Ghent. (I remember poor Newlands coming
up with his bottle of formamint just as we were
preparing to leave Ecloo.) It never occurred to
us that there was anything ominous in this mood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Torrence and I were just going to get into
(I think) Newlands' car, when we were aware of
Newlands standing fixed on the steps of the Hospital,
looking like Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, in
khaki, and flatly refusing to drive his car into
Bruges, not only if we were in his car, but if
one woman went with the expedition in any other
car.</p>

<p>He stood there, very upright, on the steps of the
Hospital, and rather pale, while the Commandant
and Mrs. Torrence surged up to him in fury. The
Commandant told him he would be sacked for insubordination,
and Mrs. Torrence, in a wild flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
of fancy, threatened to expose him "in the papers."</p>

<p>But Newlands stood his ground. He was even
more like Lord Kitchener than Tom. He simply
could not get over the idea that women were to be
protected. And to take the women into Bruges
when the Germans were, for all we knew, <i>in</i> Bruges,
was an impossibility to Newlands, as it would have
been to Lord Kitchener. So he went on refusing
to take his car into Bruges if one woman went with
the expedition. In retort to a charge of cold feet,
he intimated that he was ready to drive into any
hell you pleased, provided he hadn't got to take any
women with him. He didn't care if he <i>was</i> sacked.
He didn't care if Mrs. Torrence <i>did</i> report him in
the papers. He wouldn't drive his car into Bruges
if one woman&mdash;</p>

<p>Here, in his utter disregard of all discipline, the
likeness between Newlands and Lord Kitchener
ends. Enough that he drove his car into Bruges
on his own terms, and Mrs. Torrence and I were
left behind.</p>

<p>The expedition to Bruges returned safely with
the forty-seven Belgian wounded.</p>

<p>We found rooms in a large hotel on the Digue,
overlooking the sea. Before evening I went round
to the Hospital to see Miss Ashley-Smith's three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
wounded men. The <i>Kursaal</i> is built in terraces and
galleries going all round the front and side of it.
I took the wrong turning round one of them and
found myself in the doorway of an immense ward.
From somewhere inside there came loud and lacerating
screams, high-pitched but appallingly monotonous
and without intervals. I thought it was
a man in delirium; I even thought it might be poor
Fisher, of whose attacks we had been warned. I
went in.</p>

<p>I had barely got a yard inside the ward before
a kind little rosy-faced English nurse ran up to me.
I told her what I wanted.</p>

<p>She said, "You'd better go back. You won't be
able to stand it."</p>

<p>Even then I didn't take it in, and said I supposed
the poor man was delirious.</p>

<p>She cried out, "No! No! He is having his leg
taken off."</p>

<p>They had run short of anæsthetics.</p>

<p>I don't know what I must have looked like, but
the little rosy-faced nurse grabbed me and said,
"Come away. You'll faint if you see it."</p>

<p>And I went away. Somebody took me into the
right ward, where I found Fisher and Williams and
the other man. Fisher was none the worse for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
journey, and Williams and the other man were very
cheerful. Another English nurse, who must have
had the tact of a heavenly angel, brought up a bowl
of chicken broth and said I might feed Fisher if I
liked. So I sat a little while there, feeding Fisher,
and regretting for the hundredth time that I had not
had the foresight to be trained as a nurse when I
was young. Unfortunately, though I foresaw this
war ten years ago, I had not foreseen it when I
was young. I told the men I would come and see
them early in the morning, and bring them some
money, as I had promised Miss Ashley-Smith. I
never saw them again.</p>

<p>Nothing happened quite as I had planned it.</p>

<p>To begin with, we had discovered as we lunched
at Bruges that the funds remaining in the leather
purse-belt were hardly enough to keep the Ambulance
going for another week. And our hotel expenses
at Ostend were reducing its term to a problematic
three days. So it was more or less settled
amongst us that somebody would have to go over
to England the next day and return with funds,
and that the supernumerary Secretary was, on the
whole, the fittest person for the job.</p>

<p>I slept peaceably on this prospect of a usefulness
that seemed to justify my existence at a moment
when it most needed vindication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Tuesday, 13th.</i>]</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">got</span> up at six. Last thing at night I had said
to myself that I must wake early and go round to
the Hospital with the money.</p>

<p>With my first sleep the obsession of Ghent had
slackened its hold. And though it came back again
after I had got up, dressed and had realized my surroundings,
its returns were at longer and longer
intervals.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to go round to the
<i>Kursaal</i>. The Hospital was being evacuated, the
wounded were lying about everywhere on the terraces
and galleries, waiting for the ambulances.
Williams and Fisher and the other man were nowhere
to be seen. I was told that their ward had
been cleared out first, and that the three were now
safe on their way to England.</p>

<p>I went away very grieved that they had not got
their money.</p>

<p>At the Hotel I find the Commandant very cheerful.
He has made Miss &mdash;&mdash; his Secretary and Reporter
till my return.<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>He goes down to the quay to make arrangements
for my transport and returns after some consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>able
time. There have been difficulties about this
detail. And the Commandant has an abhorrence of
details, even of easy ones.</p>

<p>He comes back. He looks abstracted. I inquire,
a little too anxiously, perhaps, about my transport.
It is all right, all perfectly right. He has
arranged with Dr. Beavis of the British Field Hospital
to take me on his ship.</p>

<p>He looks a little spent with his exertions, and
as he has again become abstracted I forbear to press
for more information at the moment.</p>

<p>We breakfasted. Presently I ask him the name
of Dr. Beavis's ship.</p>

<p>Oh, the <i>name</i> of the ship is the <i>Dresden</i>.</p>

<p>Time passes. And presently, just as he is going,
I suggest that it would be as well for me to know
what time the <i>Dresden</i> sails.</p>

<p>This detail either he never knew or has forgotten.
And there is something about it, about the nature
of stated times, as about all things conventional and
mechanical and precise, that peculiarly exasperates
him.</p>

<p>He waves both hands in a fury of nescience and
cries, "Ask me another!"</p>

<p>By a sort of mutual consent we assume that the
<i>Dresden</i> will sail with Dr. Beavis at ten o'clock.
After all, it is a very likely hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>More time passes. Finally we go into the street
that runs along the Digue. And there we find Dr.
Beavis sitting in a motor-car. We approach him.
I thank him for his kindness in giving me transport.
I say I'm sure his ship will be crowded with his
own people, but that I don't in the least mind standing
in the stoke-hole, if <i>he</i> doesn't mind taking me
over.</p>

<p>He looks at me with a dreamy benevolence mixed
with amazement. He would take me over with
pleasure if he knew how he was to get away himself.</p>

<p>"But," I say to the Commandant, "I thought
you had arranged with Dr. Beavis to take me on the
<i>Dresden</i>."</p>

<p>The Commandant says nothing. And Dr. Beavis
smiles again. A smile of melancholy knowledge.</p>

<p>"The <i>Dresden</i>," he says, "sailed two hours ago."</p>

<p>So it is decided that I am to proceed with the
Ambulance to Dunkirk, thence by train to Boulogne,
thence to Folkestone. It sounds so simple that I
wonder why we didn't think of it before.</p>

<p>But it was not by any means so simple as it
sounded.</p>

<p>First of all we had to collect ourselves. Then
we had to collect Dr. Hanson's luggage. Dr. Hanson
was one of Mrs. St. Clair Stobart's women sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>geons,
and she had left her luggage for Miss &mdash;&mdash; to
carry from Ostend to England. There was a
yellow tin box and a suit-case. Dr. Hanson's best
clothes and her cases of surgical instruments were
in the suit-case and all the things she didn't
particularly care about in the tin box. Or else the
best clothes and the surgical instruments were in
the tin box, and the things she didn't particularly
care about in the suit-case. As we were certainly
going to take both boxes, it didn't seem to matter
much which way round it was.</p>

<p>Then there was Mr. Foster's green canvas kit-bag
to be taken to Folkestone and sent to him at
the Victoria Hospital there.</p>

<p>And there was a British Red Cross lady and her
luggage&mdash;but we didn't know anything about the
lady and her luggage yet.</p>

<p>We found them at the <i>Kursaal</i> Hospital, where
some of our ambulances were waiting.</p>

<p>By this time the courtyard, the steps and terraces
of the Hospital were a scene of the most ghastly
confusion. The wounded were still being carried
out and still lay, wrapped in blankets, on the terraces;
those who could sit or stand sat or stood.
Ambulance cars jostled each other in the courtyard.
Red Cross nurses dressed for departure were
grouped despairingly about their luggage. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
nurses, who were not dressed for departure, who
still remained superintending the removal of their
wounded, paid no attention to these groups and their
movements and their cries. The Hospital had cast
off all care for any but its wounded.</p>

<p>Women seized hold of other women for guidance
and instruction, and received none. Nobody was
rudely shaken off&mdash;they were all, in fact, very kind
to each other&mdash;but nobody had time or ability to
attend to anybody else.</p>

<p>Somebody seized hold of the Commandant and
sent us both off to look for the kitchen and for a
sack of loaves which we would find in it. We were
to bring the sack of loaves out as quickly as we
could. We went off and found the kitchen, we
found several kitchens; but we couldn't find the sack
of loaves, and had to go back without it. When
we got back the lady who had commandeered the
sack of loaves was no more to be seen on the terrace.</p>

<p>While we waited on the steps somebody remarked
that there was a German aeroplane in the sky and
that it was going to drop a bomb. There was. It
was sailing high over the houses on the other side
of the street. And it dropped its bomb right in
front of us, above an enormous building not fifty
yards away.</p>

<p>We looked, fascinated. We expected to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
building knocked to bits and flying in all directions.
The bomb fell. And nothing happened. Nothing
at all.</p>

<p>It was soon after the bomb that my attention was
directed to the lady. She was a British Red Cross
nurse, stranded with a hold-all and a green canvas
trunk, and most particularly forlorn. She had lost
her friends, she had lost her equanimity, she had
lost everything except her luggage. How she attached
herself to us I do not know. The Commandant
says it was I who made myself responsible
for her safety. We couldn't leave her to the Germans
with her green canvas trunk and her hold-all.</p>

<p>So I heaved up one end of the canvas trunk, and
the Commandant tore it from me and flung it to
the chauffeurs, who got it and the hold-all into
Bert's ambulance. I grasped the British Red Cross
lady firmly by the arm, lest she should get adrift
again, and hustled her along to the Hotel, where
the yellow tin box and the suit-case and the kit-bag
waited. Somebody got them into the ambulance
somehow.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Ursula Dearmer appeared.
(She had put up at some other hotel with Mrs.
Lambert.)</p>

<p>My British Red Cross lady was explaining to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
that she had by no means abandoned her post, but
that she was doing the right thing in leaving Ostend,
seeing that she meant to apply for another post on
a hospital ship. She was sure, she said, she was
doing the right thing. I said, as I towed her securely
along by one hand through a gathering crowd
of refugees (we were now making for the ambulance
cars that were drawn up along the street by
the Digue), I said I was equally sure she was doing
the right thing and that nobody could possibly
think otherwise.</p>

<p>And, as I say, Ursula Dearmer appeared.</p>

<p>The youngest but one was seated with Mr. Riley
in the military scouting-car that was to be our convoy
to Dunkirk. I do not know how it had happened,
but in this hour, at any rate, she had taken
over the entire control and command of the Ambulance;
and this with a coolness and competence
that suggested that it was no new thing. It suggested,
also, that without her we should not have
got away from Ostend before the Germans marched
into it. In fact, it is hardly fair to say that she
had taken everything over. Everything had lapsed
into her hands at the supreme crisis by a sort of
natural fitness.</p>

<p>We were all ready to go. The only one we yet
waited for was the Commandant, who presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
emerged from the Hotel. In his still dreamy and
abstracted movements he was pursued by an excited
waiter flourishing a bill. I forgot whose bill
it was (it may have been mine), but anyhow it
wasn't <i>his</i> bill.</p>

<p>We may have thought we were following the
retreat of the Belgian Army when we went from
Ghent to Bruges. We were, in fact, miles behind
it, and the regiments we overtook were stragglers.
The whole of the Belgian Army seemed to be poured
out on to that road between Ostend and Dunkirk.
Sometimes it was going before us, sometimes it
was mysteriously coming towards us, sometimes
it was stationary, but always it was there. It covered
the roads; we had to cut our way through it.
It was retreating slowly, as if in leisure, with a
firm, unhasting dignity.</p>

<p>Every now and then, as we looked at the men,
they smiled at us, with a curious still and tragic
smile.</p>

<p>And it is by that smile that I shall always remember
the look of the Belgian Army in the great
retreat.</p>

<p>Our own retreat&mdash;the Ostend-Dunkirk bit of
it&mdash;is memorable chiefly by Miss &mdash;&mdash;'s account
of the siege of Antwerp and the splendid courage of
Mrs. St. Clair Stobart and her women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>But that is her story, not mine, and it should be
left to her to tell.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Dunkirk.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Dunkirk the question of the Secretary's transport
again arose. It contended feebly with the
larger problem of where and when and how the
Corps was to lunch, things being further complicated
by the Commandant's impending interview
with Baron de Broqueville, the Belgian Minister of
War. I began to feel like a large and useless parcel
which the Commandant had brought with him in
sheer absence of mind, and was now anxious to
lose or otherwise get rid of. At the same time the
Ambulance could not go on for more than three
days without further funds, and, as the courier to
be despatched to fetch them, I was, for the moment,
the most important person in the Corps; and my
transport was not a question to be lightly set aside.</p>

<p>I was about to solve the problem for myself by
lugging my lady to the railway station, when
Ursula Dearmer took us over too, in her stride, as
inconsiderable items of the business before her. I
have nothing but admiration for her handling of it.</p>

<p>We halted in the main street of Dunkirk while
Mr. Riley and the chauffeurs unearthed from the
baggage-car my hold-all and suit-case and the Brit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>ish
Red Cross lady's hold-all and trunk and Mr.
Foster's kit-bag and Dr. Hanson's suit-case with
her best clothes and her surgical instruments and
the tin&mdash;No, not the tin box, for the Commandant,
now possessed by a violent demon of hurry, resisted
our efforts to drag it from its lair.<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>All these things were piled on Ursula Dearmer's
military scouting-car. The British Red Cross lady
(almost incredulous of her good luck) and I got
inside it, and Ursula Dearmer and Mr. Riley drove
us to the railway station.</p>

<p>By the mercy of Heaven a train was to leave for
Boulogne either a little before or a little after one,
and we had time to catch it.</p>

<p>There was a long line of refugee <i>bourgeois</i> drawn
up before the station doors, and I noticed that every
one of them carried in his hand a slip of paper.</p>

<p>Ursula Dearmer hailed a porter, who, she said,
would look after us like a father. With a matchless
celerity he and Mr. Riley tore down the pile
of luggage. The porter put them on a barrow and
disappeared with them very swiftly through the
station doors.</p>

<p>At least I suppose it was through the doors. All
we knew was that he disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Ursula Dearmer handed over to me three
cables to be sent from Dunkirk. I said good-bye
to her and Mr. Riley. They got back into the
motor-car, and they, too, very swiftly disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley went away bearing with him the baffling
mystery of his personality. After nearly
three weeks' association with him I know that Mr.
Riley's whole heart is in his job of carrying the
wounded. Beyond that I know no more of him
than on the day when he first turned up before our
Committee.</p>

<p>But with Ursula Dearmer it is different. Before
the Committee she appeared as a very young
girl, docile, diffident, only half-awake, and of dubious
efficiency. I remember my solemn pledges to
her mother that Ursula Dearmer should not be allowed
to go into danger, and how, if danger insisted
on coming to her, she should be violently packed
up and sent home. I remember thinking what a
nuisance Ursula Dearmer will be, and how, when
things are just beginning to get interesting, I shall
be told off to see her home.</p>

<p>And Ursula Dearmer, the youngest but one, has
gone, not at all docilely and diffidently, into the
greatest possible danger, and come out of it. And
here she is, wide awake and in full command of the
Ostend-Dunkirk expedition. And instead of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
seeing her off and all the way home, she is very
thoroughly and competently seeing <i>me</i> off.</p>

<p>At least this was her beautiful intention.</p>

<p>But getting out of France in war-time is not a
simple matter.</p>

<p>When we tried to follow the flight of our luggage
through the station door we were stopped by a
sentry with a rifle. We produced our passports.
They were not enough.</p>

<p>At the sight of us brought to halt there, all the
refugees began to agitate their slips of paper. And
on the slips we read the words "<i>Laissez-passer</i>."</p>

<p>My British Red Cross lady had no "<i>laissez-passer</i>."
I had only my sixteenth part in the
"<i>laissez-passer</i>" of the Corps, and that, hidden
away in the Commandant's breast-pocket, was a
part either of the luncheon-party or of the interview
with the Belgian Minister of War.</p>

<p>We couldn't get military passes, for military
passes take time; and the train was due in about
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>And the fatherly porter had vanished, taking with
him the secret of our luggage.</p>

<p>It was a fatherly old French gentleman who advised
us to go to the British <i>Consulat</i>. And it was
a fatherly old French <i>cocher</i> who drove us there,
or rather who drove us through interminable twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
streets and into blind alleys and out of them till
we got there.</p>

<p>As for our luggage, we renounced it and Mr.
Foster's and Dr. Hanson's luggage in the interests
of our own safety.</p>

<p>At last we got to the British <i>Consulat</i>. Only I
think the <i>cocher</i> took us to the Town Hall and the
Hospital and the British Embassy and the Admiralty
offices first.</p>

<p>At intervals during this transit the British Red
Cross lady explained again that she was doing the
right thing in leaving Ostend. It wasn't as if she
was leaving her post, she was going on a hospital
ship. She was sure she had done the right
thing.</p>

<p>It was not for me to be unsympathetic to an obsession
produced by a retreat, so I assured her again
and again that if there ever was a right thing she
had done it. My heart bled for this poor lady,
abandoned by the organization that had brought her
out.</p>

<p>In the courtyard of the <i>Consulat</i> we met a stalwart
man in khaki, who smiled as a god might
smile at our trouble, and asked us why on earth
we hadn't got a passage on the naval transport
<i>Victoria</i>, sailing at three o'clock. We said nothing
would have pleased us better, only we had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
heard of the <i>Victoria</i> and her sailing. And he took
us to the Consul, and the Consul&mdash;who must have
been buried alive in detail&mdash;gave us a letter to
Captain King of the <i>Victoria</i>, and the <i>cocher</i> drove
us to the dock.</p>

<p>Captain King was an angel. He was the head of
a whole hierarchy of angels who called themselves
ship's officers.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty about our transport. But
we must be at the docks by half-past two.</p>

<p>We have an hour before us; so we drive back to
the station to see if, after all, we can find that luggage.
Not that we in the least expected to find it,
for we had been told that it had gone on by the
train to Boulogne.</p>

<p>Now the British Red Cross lady declared many
times that but for me and my mastery of the French
language she would never have got out of Dunkirk.
And it was true that I looked on her more as a
sacred charge than as a valuable ally in the struggle
with French sentries, porters and officials. As for
the <i>cocher</i>, I didn't consider him valuable at all,
even as the driver of an ancient <i>fiacre</i>. And yet
it was the lady and the <i>cocher</i> who found the luggage.
It seems that the station hall is open between
trains, and they had simply gone into the hall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
seen it there, withdrawn bashfully into a corner.
The <i>cocher's</i> face as he announces his discovery
makes the War seem a monstrous illusion. It is
incredible that anything so joyous should exist in
a country under German invasion.</p>

<p>We drive again to the <i>Victoria</i> in her dock. The
stewards run about and do things for us. They
give us lunch. They give us tea. And the other
officers come in and make large, simple jokes about
bombs and mines and submarines. We have the
ship all to ourselves except for a few British soldiers,
recruits sent out to Antwerp too soon and
sent back again for more training.</p>

<p>They looked, poor boys, far sadder than the Belgian
Army.</p>

<p>And I walk the decks; I walk the decks till we

Every now and then I see her engaged in
earnest conversation with the ship's officers; and I
wonder whether she is telling them that she has not
really left her post and that she is sure she has done
right. I am no longer concerned about my own
post, for I feel so sure that I am going back to it.</p>

<p>To-morrow I shall get the money from our Committee;
and on Thursday I shall go back.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;I must have had a pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>monition.
We are approaching England. I can
see the white cliffs.</p>

<p>And I hate the white cliffs. I hate them with a
sudden and mysterious hatred.</p>

<p>More especially I hate the cliffs of Dover. For
it is there that we must land. I should not have
thought it possible to hate the white coast of my own
country when she is at war.</p>

<p>And now I know that I hate it because it is not
the coast of Flanders. Which would be absurd if
I were really going back again.</p>

<p>Yes, I must have had a premonition.</p>

<p class="centerspaced2">[<i>Dover.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have landed now. I have said good-bye to
Captain King and all the ship's officers and thanked
them for their kindness. I have said good-bye to
the British Red Cross lady, who is not going to
London.</p>

<p>And I go to the station telegraph-office to send
off five wires.</p>

<p>I am sending off the five wires when I hear feet
returning through the station hall. The Red Cross
lady is back again. She is saying this time that she
is <i>really</i> sure she has done the right thing.</p>

<p>And again I assure her that she has.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Well&mdash;there are obsessions and obsessions. I
do not know whether I have done the right thing or
not in leaving Flanders (or, for that matter, in
leaving Ghent). All that I know is that I love it
and that I have left it. And that I want to go back.</p>

<p>There have been changes in that Motor Field Ambulance
Corps that set out for Flanders on the 25th of
September, 1914.</p>

<p>Its Commandant has gone from it to join the Royal
Army Medical Corps. A few of the original volunteers
have dropped out and others have taken their
places, and it is larger now than it was, and better organized.</p>

<p>But whoever went and whoever stayed, its four field-women
have remained at the Front. Two of them are
attached to the Third Division of the Belgian Army;
all four have distinguished themselves by their devotion
to that Army and by their valour, and they have
all received the Order of Leopold II., the highest Belgian
honour ever given to women.</p>

<p>The Commandant, being a man, has the Order of
Leopold I. Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett and Mr. Philip
Gibbs and Dr. Souttar have described his heroic action
at the Battle of Dixmude on the 22nd of October,
1914, when he went into the cellars of the burning and
toppling Town Hall to rescue the wounded. And
from that day to this the whole Corps&mdash;old volunteers
and new&mdash;has covered itself with glory.</p>

<p>On our two chauffeurs, Tom and Bert, the glory lies
quite thick. "Tom" (if I may quote from my own
story of the chauffeurs) "Tom was in the battle of
Dixmude. At the order of his commandant he drove
his car straight into the thick of it, over the ruins of
a shattered house that blocked the way. He waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
with his car while all the bombs that he had ever
dreamed of crashed around him, and houses flamed,
and tottered and fell. 'Pretty warm, ain't it?' was
Tom's comment.</p>

<p>"Four days later he was waiting at Oudekappele
with his car when he heard that the Hospital of Saint-Jean
at Dixmude was being shelled and that the Belgian
military man who had been sent with a motor-car
to carry off the wounded had been turned back by the
fragment of a shell that dropped in front of him.
Tom thereupon drove into Dixmude to the Hospital of
Saint-Jean and removed from it two wounded soldiers
and two aged and paralysed civilians who had sheltered
there, and brought them to Furnes. The military
ambulance men then followed his lead, and the
Hospital was emptied. That evening it was destroyed
by a shell.</p>

<p>"And Bert&mdash;it was Bert who drove his ambulance
into Kams-Kappele to the barricade by the railway.
It was Bert who searched in a shell-hole to pick out
three wounded from among thirteen dead; who with
the help of a Belgian priest, carried the three several
yards to his car, under fire, and who brought them in
safety to Furnes."</p>

<p>And the others, the brave "Chaplain," and "Mr.
Riley," and "Mr. Lambert," have also proved themselves.</p>

<p>But when I think of the Corps it is chiefly of the
four field-women that I think&mdash;the two "women of
Pervyse," and the other two who joined them at their
dangerous <i>poste</i>.</p>

<p>Both at Furnes and Pervyse they worked all night,
looking after their wounded; sometimes sleeping on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
straw in a room shared by the Belgian troops, when
there was no other shelter for them in the bombarded
town. One of them has driven a heavy ambulance
car&mdash;in a pitch-black night, along a road raked by
shell-fire, and broken here and there into great pits&mdash;to
fetch a load of wounded, a performance that would
have racked the nerves of any male chauffeur ever
born. She has driven the same car, <i>alone</i>, with five
German prisoners for her passengers. The four
women served at Pervyse (the town nearest to the
firing-line) in "Mrs. Torrence's" dressing-station&mdash;a
cellar only twenty yards behind the Belgian trenches.
In that cellar, eight feet square and lighted and ventilated
only by a slit in the wall, two lived for three
weeks, sleeping on straw, eating what they could get,
drinking water that had passed through a cemetery
where nine hundred Germans are buried. They had
to burn candles night and day. Here the wounded
were brought as they fell in the trenches, and were
tended until the ambulance came to take them to the
base hospital at Furnes.</p>

<p>Day in, day out, and all night long, with barely an
interval for a wash or a change of clothing, the women
stayed on, the two always, and the four often, till the
engineers built them a little hut for a dressing-station;
they stayed till the Germans shelled them out
of their little hut.</p>

<p>This is only a part of what they have done. The
finest part will never be known, for it was done in solitary
places and in the dark, when special correspondents
are asleep in their hotels. There was no limelight
on the road between Dixmude and Furnes, or
among the blood and straw in the cellar at Pervyse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>And Miss Ashley-Smith (who is now Mrs. McDougall)&mdash;her
escape from Ghent (when she had no
more to do there) was as heroic as her return.</p>

<p>Since then she has gone back to the Front and done
splendid service in her own Corps, the First Aid Nursing
Yeomanry.</p>

Day-Book as Saturday, 3rd, with a note that the British came
into Ghent on their way to Antwerp on the evening of that
day. Now I believe there were no British in Antwerp before
the evening of Sunday, the 4th, yet "Dr. Wilson" and Mr.
Davidson, going into Saint Nicolas before us, saw the British
there, and "Mrs. Torrence" and "Janet McNeil" saw more
British come into Ghent in the evening. I was ill with fever
the day after the run into Antwerp, and got behindhand with
my Day-Book. So it seems safest to assume that I made a
wrong entry and that we went into Antwerp on Sunday, and
to record Saturday's events as spreading over the whole day.
Similarly the events that the Day-Book attributes to Monday
must have belonged to Tuesday. And if Tuesday's events
were really Wednesday's, that clears up a painful doubt I had
as to Wednesday, which came into my Day-Book as an empty
extra which I couldn't account for in any way. There I was
with a day left over and nothing to put into it. And yet
Wednesday, the 7th, was the first day of the real siege of
Antwerp. On Thursday, the 8th, I started clear.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_9" id="Footnote_8_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_9"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> It wasn't. This was only the first slender trickling. The

out that the car was not the property of his paper, but his

this brave and devoted young American had joined our Corps
before it left England and gone out to the front to wait for us.
And he was kept waiting long after we got there.

But if he didn't see as much service at Ghent as he undertook
to see (though he did some fine things on his own even
there), it was made up to him in Flanders afterwards, when,
with the Commandant and other members of the Corps, he
distinguished himself by his gallantry at Furnes and in the
Battle of Dixmude.

<p>Every reader of "The Divine Fire," in fact every reader of any of Miss
Sinclair's books, will at once accord her unlimited praise for her character work.
"The Three Sisters" reveals her at her best. It is a story of temperament,
made evident not through tiresome analyses but by means of a series of dramatic
incidents. The sisters of the title represent three distinct types of womankind.
In their reaction under certain conditions Miss Sinclair is not only
telling a story of tremendous interest but she is really showing a cross section
of life.</p>

<p>"Once again Miss Sinclair has shown us that among the women writers to-day
she can be acclaimed as without rival in the ability to draw a character
and to suggest atmosphere.... In "The Three Sisters" she gives full measure
of her qualities. It is in every way a characteristic novel."&mdash;<i>London

<p>By many army officers the author of this work is regarded as the foremost
military expert in the United States. For nine years he has been
striving to awaken the American people to a knowledge of the weaknesses
of their land forces and the defencelessness of the country. Out of his extensive
study and research he has compiled the present volume, which
represents the last word on this subject. It comes at a time when its importance
cannot be overestimated, and in the eight hundred odd pages
given over to the discussion there are presented facts and arguments with
which every citizen should be familiar. Mr. Huidekoper's writings in this
field are already well known. These hitherto, however, have been largely
confined to magazines and pamphlets, but his book deals with the matters
under consideration with that frankness and authority evidenced in these
previous contributions and much more comprehensively.</p>

<p class="centerspacedbold">AN IMPORTANT NEW WORK</p>

<h2 class="sp">With the Russian Army</h2>

<p class="center">By Col. ROBERT McCORMICK</p>

<p class="right"><i>Illustrated, 8vo</i></p>

<p>This book deals with the author's experiences in the
war area. The work traces the cause of the war from
the treaty of 1878 through the Balkan situation. It
contains many facts drawn from personal observation,
for Col. McCormick has had opportunities such as have
been given to no other man during the present engagements.
He has been at the various headquarters and
actually in the trenches. One of the most interesting
chapters of the volume is the concluding one dealing
with great personalities of the war from first-hand
acquaintance.</p>

<p>The work contains a considerable amount of material
calculated to upset generally accepted ideas, comparisons
of the fighting forces, and much else that is fresh
and original.</p>

<h2 class="spsp">The World War:</h2>

<p class="centerbold">How it Looks to the Nations Involved and What it Means to Us</p>

<p class="center">By ELBERT FRANCIS BALDWIN</p>

<p class="right"><i>Decorated cloth, 12mo, $1.25</i></p>

<p>The present war in Europe has called forth a great many
books bearing on its different phases, but in the majority of
instances these have been written from the standpoint of some
one of the nations. Elbert Francis Baldwin has here, however,
brought together within the compass of a single volume
a survey of the entire field.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin was in Europe at the outbreak of hostilities.
He mingled with the people, observing their spirit and temper
more intimately than it has been permitted most writers
to do, and in consequence the descriptions which he gives of
the German, or French, or English, or Russian attitude are
truer and more complete than those found in previous studies
of the war. Mr. Baldwin's statements are calm and just in
conclusion. When discussing the German side he has included
all of the factors which the Germans think important,
and assimilated wholly the German feeling, as he has done in
his considerations of the other countries.</p>

<h2 class="spsp">Russia and the World</h2>

<p class="center">By STEPHEN GRAHAM<br />
<br />
Author of "With the Russian Pilgrims to Jerusalem," "With Poor Immigrants<br />
to America," etc.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Illustrated, cloth, 8vo, $2.00</i></p>

<p>At the outbreak of the present European war Mr. Graham was
in Russia, and his book opens, therefore, with a description of the
way the news of war was received on the Chinese frontier, one
thousand miles from a railway station, where he happened to be
when the Tsar's summons came. Following this come other chapters
on Russia and the War, considering such questions as, Is It a
Last War?, Why Russia Is Fighting, The Economic Isolation of
Russia, An Aeroplane Hunt at Warsaw, Suffering Poland: A Belgium
of the East, and The Soldier and the Cross.</p>

<p>But "Russia and the World" is not by any means wholly a war
book. It is a comprehensive survey of Russian problems. Inasmuch
as the War is at present one of her problems, it receives its
due consideration. It has been, however, Mr. Graham's intention
to supply the very definite need that there is for enlightenment in
English and American circles as to the Russian nation, what its
people think and feel on great world matters. On almost every
country there are more books and more concrete information than
on his chosen land. In fact, "Russia and the World" may be regarded
as one of the very first to deal with it in any adequate fashion.</p>

<p>"It shows the author creeping as near as he was allowed to the
firing line. It gives broad views of difficult questions, like the future
of the Poles and the Jews. It rises into high politics, forecasts the
terms of peace and the rearrangement of the world, east and west,
that may follow. But the salient thing in it is its interpretation for
Western minds of the spirit of Russia."&mdash;<i>London Times.</i></p>

<h2 class="spsp">German World Policies</h2>

<p class="centerbold">(Der Deutsche Gedanke in der Welt)</p>

<p class="center">By PAUL ROHRBACH<br />
<br />
Translated by <span class="smcap">Dr. Edmund von Mach</span></p>

<p class="right"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25</i></p>

<p>Paul Rohrbach has been for several years the most popular
author of books on politics and economics in Germany. He is
described by his translator as a "constructive optimist," one who,
at the same time, is an incisive critic of those shortcomings which
have kept Germany, as he thinks, from playing the great part to
which she is called. In this volume Dr. Rohrbach gives a true insight
into the character of the German people, their aims, fears and
aspirations.</p>

<p>Though it was written before the war started and has not been
hastily put together, it still possesses peculiar significance now, for
in its analysis of the German idea of culture and its dissemination,
in its consideration of German foreign policies and moral conquests,
it is an important contribution to the widespread speculation now
current on these matters.</p>
